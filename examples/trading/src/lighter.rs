//! Lighter read into the model `hyperliquid` defines, so a row from either

//! the same object — sometimes for the same quantity — so every field goes
//! through the same tolerant readers `hyperliquid` uses rather than a derive.
//!
//! Every unit that could be read two ways was settled against live responses
//! rather than guessed, and each one carries the identity that proved it.

// Read-only and complete, but nothing points at it until the venue switch

// What Lighter actually answered.
//
// Four responses off the live venue, trimmed in rows and in fields but never
// in figures. They are the fixtures this module's parsers are checked against
// and, run through those same parsers, they are also the Lighter the app draws
// when it is drawing a fixture rather than a feed. One copy serves both on
// purpose: a demo universe written by hand beside a captured one is a second
// opinion about what this venue lists, and the two drift the moment either is
// touched. Every number a Lighter screen shows therefore comes back to a
// number the venue published.
//
// The four were taken within the same market day and cross-check each other:
// the account's positions are markets the universe lists, and multiplying each
// position's value by its market's published maintenance fraction reproduces
// the requirement the account states — which is the check
// `maintenance_in_basis_points_reproduces_the_accounts_requirement` runs.

/// `GET /orderBookDetails`, trimmed to the markets the fixtures need out of
/// the 222 the venue lists.
///
/// The trim is not arbitrary: every market the captured account holds a
/// position in is here, so the two payloads describe one terminal; MKR is here
/// because a retired market keeps its row and has to be dropped by `status`
/// rather than by its numbers; and AAPL and 1000PEPE are here because they are
/// the two shapes of difference from the other venue's universe — a market
/// Hyperliquid does not list at all, and a coin it lists under another
/// spelling.
