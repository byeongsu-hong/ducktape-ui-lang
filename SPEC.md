# Ice Language Specification 2.0 Preview

Status: implemented candidate

Ice is a small frontend language with an iced backend. It is not Rust syntax,
JSX, or a token shortcut around a procedural macro. A frontend parses `.ice`
source, resolves names and types, checks UI semantics, and lowers a typed tree
to backend code.

This document describes what the repository implements. A section explicitly
marked “planned” is a design constraint, not accepted candidate syntax.

## 1. Design contract

Ice optimizes for two readers:

- a person should understand the screen, state, and effects by scanning it;
- an agent should see one canonical construct for each operation and receive a
  local error instead of guessing framework conventions.

The language therefore follows these rules:

1. Structure is indentation, with no closing delimiters.
2. UI state and transitions are explicit; generated messages and borrows are
   not.
3. Expressions are a small closed language, not embedded Rust.
4. Style utilities are a checked vocabulary. Unknown or ineffective utilities
   are errors.
5. Domain work crosses a typed `extern` boundary.
6. The compiler has one parser and checker shared by every frontend.

Ice owns transient/display state, layout, style, event routing, and calls to
actions. Rust owns validation, invariants, persistence, networking, security,
observability, and platform-specific behavior.

```text
interaction -> handler -> extern async Rust fn -> result handler -> state -> view
```

UI validation such as disabling an empty submit button is only a convenience.
The Rust action must still validate its input.

### Core and backend boundary

Ice Core is the stable authoring surface: `app`, `use`, `enum`, `state`, `derived`,
`component`, `slot`, `on`, `view`, `if`, `match`, `for`, `keyed`, and `lazy`;
common row, column, stack, scroll, and box layout; text, input, button,
checkbox, and image widgets; bindings, routes, payloads, scoped IDs, typed
extern calls, and basic async success/failure routing.

A new Core construct must be common UI authoring, have one canonical source
form, and not fit an existing typed Rust boundary. The implemented 2.0
vocabulary is frozen during preview stabilization. Spellings removed in this
revision are syntax errors and the formatter never translates old vocabulary.
Vocabulary changes require an explicit language design decision and revision;
removed forms and their callers are deleted in the same change rather than
retained behind compatibility paths.

Canvas paths, complete PaneGrid mutation, raw window/platform values, shaders,
custom renderers, task-composition variants, and exhaustive native status styles
are the extended surface. It is not a parity roadmap and must not grow only
because iced exposes another public type or method.

Language revisions and Cargo package versions use separate schemes. This
document specifies language revision 2.0. The workspace packages are
pre-1.0 SemVer `0.1.0`; their package version does not claim language 0.1. The
resolved iced/iced_widget versions are a third, independent backend baseline.

### Accessibility contract

Ice owns a small accessibility layer above stock Iced. Generated Core nodes
produce a deterministic AccessKit tree with these mappings:

| Ice node | AccessKit role | Semantic state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `Label` | the visible text is its value |
| `input` | `TextInput` | label, optional description, value, disabled/focus state |
| secure `input` | `PasswordInput` | label, optional description, disabled/focus state; no value is exported |
| `button` | `Button` | label, optional description, disabled/focus state, click action |
| `checkbox` | `CheckBox` | label, optional description, toggled/disabled/focus state, click action |
| `toggler` | `Switch` | label, optional description, toggled/disabled/focus state, click action |
| `slider` | `Slider` | default `Slider` label, current value, focus state |
| `progress` | `ProgressIndicator` | default `Progress` label and current value |
| `pick` | `ComboBox` | placeholder/default label, selected value, focus state |
| `combo` | `ComboBox` | search placeholder label, selected value, focus state |
| `editor` | `MultilineTextInput` | placeholder/default label, current value, disabled/focus state |
| labeled `image` | `Image` | label and optional description |

`label=` and `description=` are checked `str` expressions. The positional input
label, compact button string, and visible checkbox or toggler label are default
accessible names; an explicit `label=` overrides them. Pick and combo controls
use their placeholder, while editors use their placeholder or `Editor` when it
is absent. Slider and progress use the stable defaults `Slider` and `Progress`.
A button whose content is a child node requires `label=` (`E105`). An image
without `label=` is decorative and is omitted from the semantic tree; media
`description=` without `label=` is also `E105`. Secure inputs use
`PasswordInput` and never copy their state value into the accessibility tree.

Semantic read order and keyboard focus order follow source/view-tree order.
Tab and Shift+Tab traverse enabled interactive controls; disabled controls
expose disabled state but no focus/click action and are skipped. Enter and Space
activate a focused button, while Space activates a focused checkbox or toggler.
Wrapper-focused controls draw a two-pixel outline; inputs, editors, sliders,
pick lists, and combo boxes retain their native focused rendering. There is no
numeric focus-order syntax.

Tree construction, focus updates, duplicate-ID disambiguation, and action
routing are deterministic across platforms. Native screen-reader export is a
separate, narrower contract: `accesskit_unix` exports a single-window Linux
application over AT-SPI, while `accesskit_windows` exports a single-window
Windows application through UI Automation. The Windows bootstrap forces
Iced's automatically created initial main window to start hidden, windowed,
and non-maximized, then resolves its ID with `window::oldest()`. Boot or preset
work and received messages are held until AccessKit subclasses the Win32
handle; it then restores the configured main-window mode and releases the
selected initial task alongside queued messages, preserving queue order.
Fullscreen takes precedence over maximized, matching Winit creation semantics;
`visible=false`
takes precedence over both and does not retain their latent state because Iced
cannot preserve it without showing the window. Named windows retain their
configured settings and remain outside native export. Stock Iced 0.14.0 does
not expose the window-scoped operations or desktop transform needed for
daemon/multi-window adapters or exact screen-coordinate bounds. Other targets
retain the deterministic tree/action behavior without a native screen-reader
adapter. Rich text and advanced widgets are outside this Core semantic
contract.

## 2. Compiler model

```text
UTF-8 .ice source graph
  -> relative `use` resolution + source map
  -> indentation-aware parser
  -> AST
  -> name resolution + type inference + semantic checks
  -> CheckedDocument
  -> private normalized LoweredProgram
  -> iced Rust backend
  -> rustc
```

`ui-lang-core` owns the parser, AST, checker, formatter, and backend.
`ui-lang-build` is the Cargo build-script adapter, `ui-lang` is the include-only
proc macro, and `cargo-ice` owns workspace tooling. There is no runtime parser.

A consuming package declares `ui-lang-build` as a build dependency and compiles
its Ice source directory through Cargo's standard build-script phase:

```rust
// build.rs
fn main() {
    ui_lang_build::compile_dir("src/ui").expect("compile Ice sources");
}
```

The build helper discovers every top-level `app` or `daemon` root below that
directory, checks each complete import graph, emits dependency tracking for all
root and imported `.ice` files, and writes generated Rust below
`OUT_DIR/ui-lang-generated`. Cargo therefore isolates output by consuming
package, profile, and target and removes it with `cargo clean`. A generated
Rust filename is the lowercase full SHA-256 of the normalized
manifest-relative Ice root plus `.rs`; its component length never grows with
the source path. `OUT_DIR/ui-lang-generated/manifest.json` is the canonical
versioned mapping from those filenames back to source roots and generated
content digests. A generation-directory lock serializes publishers. Each
changed output and the next manifest are staged, flushed, and synced before
outputs are atomically replaced and the manifest is atomically replaced last.
Missing, malformed, unsupported, incomplete, or digest-mismatched cache state
is disposable and triggers full regeneration; stale transaction files are
removed automatically. A hash collision remains a hard build error, and
byte-identical output is not replaced so its mtime remains stable.

Successful semantic analysis returns the nominal `CheckedDocument` boundary;
only the checker can construct it. Lowering consumes that value and publishes
an owned `LoweredProgram`, which is the only input accepted by Rust generation.
Neither compiler representation contains Iced values or generated Rust
fragments.

The release `LoweredProgram` contains no source `Document` and no checker-fact
arena. Test builds retain poisonable sidecars only to prove that post-lowering
source or fact mutation cannot affect production emission. The normalized
program owns typed arenas and stable IDs for declarations, expressions, values,
locals, handlers, statements, tasks, views, routes, subscriptions, tests,
components, styles, themes, and physical origins. Lowering fixes defaults,
ownership, lexical scope, coercions, static topology, route payloads, extern and
named-type identities, Rust targets, and source locations before the backend
runs.

Expression emission reads the owned `ResolvedExpressionProgram`; release code
generation cannot reach `CheckedFacts`, repeat checker analysis, resolve an
extern by source name, or fall back to a raw expression. Builtins, enum owners
and variants, calls, projections, locals, and coercions are already resolved.
The backend still shares canonical semantic value types such as `Type` and
`Span` with the frontend. Those values describe type and source-location
semantics, not source-AST topology or checker state.

Component contracts, calls, slots, bindings, storage, output forwarding,
handler flow, subscription delivery, view control flow, widget options, styles,
themes, Canvas commands, test actions, and application settings all use the
same normalized ownership model. `OriginId` values index one physical origin
arena, so imported diagnostics and generated source markers do not recover
locations from AST nodes.

The `hir_boundary` integration ratchet keeps the production code-generation
inventory empty for source-AST imports and semantic references, checked-document
and checker-fact escapes, declaration-index access, type re-analysis, extern
re-resolution, raw-expression fallback, and direct `Document`, `Expr`, `Route`,
or `Statement` references. Structural snapshots, invalid-ID and ownership
corruption tests, post-check and post-lowering poisoning tests, imported-source
diagnostics, generated-Rust fixtures, and scale contracts provide executable
evidence for that boundary.

The Rust adapter is one manifest-relative include:

```rust
ui_lang::include_app!("src/ui/tasks.ice");

fn main() -> iced::Result {
    Tasks::run()
}
```

The macro performs no parsing, code generation, or filesystem writes. It maps
the manifest-relative literal to the corresponding file in `OUT_DIR` and
expands one `include!`. Generated Rust emits probes for every declared extern
struct field and async function. Rustc therefore rejects missing, private, or
shape-incompatible Rust items even when an extern declaration is not reached
at runtime. Component probes are emitted from normalized declaration HIR,
including declarations with no view call site. Generated items suppress
backend-only Rust and Clippy warnings at their item boundary without changing
their enclosing module, visibility, or name resolution; compile errors remain
unsuppressed.

Generated Rust refers to the public `::iced` and `::ui_lang_runtime` paths, so
a consuming application must declare `iced = "=0.14.0"` and
`ui-lang-runtime = "=0.1.0"` as direct dependencies. It must also declare
`ui-lang-build = "=0.1.0"` as a direct build dependency.
The runtime pins AccessKit, `accesskit_unix` on Linux, and `accesskit_windows`
on Windows; the reference application uses workspace paths with exact
versions. `cargo ice compat` verifies the lockfile and direct-manifest contract.

## 3. Source rules

- Files are UTF-8 and use the `.ice` extension.
- Tabs are errors. `cargo ice fmt` prints two spaces per indentation level.
- A deeper indentation level makes the following lines children of the prior
  line. Indentation may only return to an existing level.
- Empty lines are ignored by the parser and normalized by the formatter.
- A line whose first non-space characters are `//` is a comment. Inline and
  block comments are not part of 2.0.
- Identifiers use ASCII letters, digits, and `_`; they cannot begin with a digit
  or `__`, and `_`, `none`, and Rust keywords are reserved.
- Rust path segments use Rust identifier rules; the Ice-only `none` and `__`
  reservations do not apply to them.
- App, extern-struct, and component names conventionally use `PascalCase`.
- State, field, function, handler, and parameter names conventionally use
  `snake_case`.
- Static IDs use kebab case after `#`, for example `#task-list`.
- Strings use double quotes and support `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\"`, and `\\`.
- A top-level `use "relative/file.ice"` includes declarations relative to the
  importing file. Paths must end in `.ice`, use `/`, and cannot be absolute.
- `use "relative/file.ice" as ui` imports components, recipes, extern items,
  fonts, and named types under `ui::`. Theme tokens remain app-global. Bare
  imports keep the fragment-merging behavior above.
- Imports may be nested. Re-importing the same canonical file is idempotent;
  aliased instances are unique by canonical file and namespace. Import cycles
  and missing files are errors.

Top-level declarations are order-independent, but canonical source uses:

```text
app | daemon
use
extern
theme contract
palette
recipe
state
preset
component
on
subscribe
view
test
```

An Ice source graph has exactly one `app` or `daemon` root and one `view`.
It may have multiple `extern` namespaces; imported plugin fragments can
therefore bind their own Rust modules beside the application's backend.
Bare extern type and function names remain graph-global and duplicates are
errors. Aliased imports retain their namespace identity instead of flattening
those declarations into the graph-global name set.
The root file declares the app and normally the view; imported fragments may
hold any other top-level declarations. The graph may have multiple components,
handlers, and graph-unique tests. The view and each component have exactly one
root node.

## 4. Compact grammar

The grammar below uses indentation (`INDENT`) as a block delimiter. `expr` is
defined in section 6.

Plain `text` nodes support mouse drag selection across explicit and wrapped
lines. The active selection supports the platform copy and select-all
shortcuts; Escape clears it.

Application configuration lives under the app declaration. The four iced
callbacks accept state expressions directly:

```ice

  bg app_background
  fg app_text

state
  window_title = "Ice Tasks"
  app_theme = "app"
  active_palette:palette[ProductTheme] = ProductTheme.light
  app_background = "#0f172a"
  app_text = "#f8fafc"
  ui_scale = 1.0
```

`title`, `theme`, `palette`, `bg`, `fg`, and `scale` are recomputed
from current state through iced's native callbacks. Title/theme/style values are
typed `str`; scale is `f64`. Theme accepts `app`, `default`, or any of iced's 22
kebab-case built-ins. Palette accepts only `palette[Contract]`; each declared
palette is a compiler-generated `Contract.name` variant. Unknown names and
values from a different contract are compile-time errors, and generated
selection is exhaustive with no runtime fallback.
Application colors accept 3/4/6/8 digit hexadecimal strings. Invalid dynamic
theme/color values safely retain the generated app theme or selected theme base
style, and a non-positive dynamic scale is clamped to `f32::EPSILON`. Literal
mistakes are rejected during analysis.

The remaining application values lower to iced `Settings` and builder
configuration. Generated `run` delegates to one internal typed program builder;
first-class tests use that same program contract—presets, theme, settings,
update, view, tasks, and subscriptions—without reconstructing application
wiring. A test `mount` substitutes one checked view root while retaining the
same generated state/update program. Section 9 defines the complete test mode.
`executor` is a Rust type path passed to iced's typed `Application::executor`;
rustc reports a local generated-code error when the type is missing or does not
implement `iced::Executor`.
`renderer` selects the app's concrete `iced::program::Renderer` type. It
defaults to `iced::Renderer`; generated view and extern `Element` signatures
use the selected type, so rustc checks its renderer, compositor, text, and
headless contracts at the generated boundary.
Each `font` path is relative to the root `.ice` file, must name an existing
file during `cargo ice check`, and lowers to iced's startup
`.font(include_bytes!(...))` builder. Repeating the same path is rejected;
different files may be loaded in declaration order.
The unnamed `window` block configures the initial window. A named block such
as `window child` declares a checked settings template that `task window open`
can instantiate; names must be unique. Both forms cover every cross-platform
`window::Settings` field:
initial/minimum/maximum size, maximized/fullscreen state,
default/centered/fixed position, visibility, resizability, close/minimize
buttons, decorations, transparency, blur, level, and close-request behavior.
Nested `platform linux`, `platform windows`, `platform macos`, and
`platform wasm` blocks expose every field of iced's target-specific settings.
All four may coexist in one source; generated `cfg` blocks select only the
current compilation target. Wasm `target none` appends to the document body.
Sizes, text size, and scale factor must be positive; minimum size cannot exceed
maximum size. `icon-rgba` embeds a relative raw RGBA file without an image
codec; width and height are positive integers whose product fits the native
`u32` pixel count, and generated Rust rejects a byte length other than
`width × height × 4`. `cargo ice check` reports a
mismatch at the icon declaration, and generated Rust repeats the check at
compile time. Encoded icon formats remain outside 2.0.

The `tray` block declares a system status item — on macOS, an `NSStatusItem`
in the menu bar. `icon-rgba` is required and follows the window icon
convention exactly: a relative raw RGBA file embedded without an image codec,
byte length checked as `width × height × 4` at both check and compile time.
`icon-template true` marks the icon as a macOS template image (black plus
alpha, recolored by the system for light and dark menu bars; ignored
elsewhere). `label` and `tooltip` are `str` expressions with app-`title`
semantics: re-evaluated after every update, applied natively only when the
value changed. `label` renders live text beside the icon.

`popover name` names a window template declared on the same root and requires
`daemon`, because iced renders one view per application window while daemon
views branch per window. A left click on the status item toggles that window:
opened hidden, positioned under the icon's screen rectangle (physical
coordinates converted through the popover's scale factor, clamped to that
display when the icon is on it), then shown and focused; a second click — or
any `task window close` — closes it, tracked through the window's close event.

The popover owns its own dismissal: once it has taken focus, losing focus
closes it, so clicking anywhere outside puts it away without the application
subscribing to anything. That gate is not decoration. A window reports itself
unfocused while it is still being created, before it has ever been on screen,
so a dismissal that trusted the first report would close the panel before it
was drawn and a click on the item would look like nothing at all. Only a
popover that actually took focus can be dismissed by losing it.

`task tray close` puts the popover away from a handler. No window id in scope
names it — an untargeted `task window close` acts on the oldest window, which
in an application that also opens its own windows is the wrong one — so this
is the only way a handler can dismiss the panel, and it is rejected unless the
tray declares a popover.

A declared `popover` also adds the read-only `popover` binding: a `bool`,
true only while the view is drawing the window the status item opened. One
view answers for the panel and for the application's own windows without the
application tracking window IDs to tell them apart, and state may not be named
`popover` while it exists. `tray click` presses the status item from a `test`,
so a panel is exercised through the same open-and-anchor path a press takes.

Pressing the item unfocuses the popover first, so the dismissal runs before
the click is delivered; a press within 200ms of the popover closing therefore
counts as that dismissal rather than a request to reopen. Without `popover`, a
left click restores and focuses the program's oldest window, which suits an
`app` whose tray is a live status readout. Only the left click is wired;
right and middle clicks are ignored.

Platform mapping: macOS is fully implemented. On every other target the same
program compiles and runs with the tray as a runtime no-op; the native tray on
Windows has no label text, so `label` is a macOS surface by nature. Setting
`ICE_TRAY_DEBUG` traces the native boundary — status item creation, each
platform event, whether the click reached the subscription, and the anchor it
resolved to — because a status item that does nothing looks the same whether
the platform never delivered the click, the bridge dropped it, or the panel
landed off-screen.

Use `daemon Name` instead of `app Name` for an iced daemon that starts without
an initial window and remains alive after all windows close. A daemon rejects
the unnamed `window` block; declare named window templates and open them from
`on mount` or another handler. The read-only `window:window-id` binding names
the window currently being rendered and is available to the root view, title,
theme, and scale expressions. Pure components receive it explicitly as
a typed prop. Standalone `exit` is a native `iced::exit()` task and must be the
final statement in a handler (or a task-group member):

Application boot presets are structured top-level declarations:

```ice
preset pristine

preset seeded
  state
    draft = "Preset task"
    loading = true
  boot
    run list_tasks() -> loaded _ | failed _
```

Each preset starts from declared state and internal widget layout state without
running `on mount`. The optional `state` section applies checked assignments in
order. The optional `boot` section accepts the same checked statements, task
composition, and routes as a handler. With no task it returns `Task::none`.
Generated code passes each strategy to iced `Preset::new`; an empty preset is a
side-effect-free default-state fixture.

Media fixed lengths, opacity, scale, and radius are `f64`. `fit=` accepts its
compact contain/cover/fill/none/scale-down names or a first-class `content-fit`
expression. `rotate=` requires a first-class `rotation` expression. Opacity is
`0.0..=1.0`, scale is positive, and
sizes/radius are non-negative. `filter`, `scale`, `expand`, `radius`, and `crop` are image-only.
Crop is `(x, y, width, height)` in non-negative `i64` source-pixel coordinates.
`memory`, `color`, and `hover` are SVG-only. `memory` accepts UTF-8 SVG text or
raw `bytes`; `color` filters both statuses and `hover` overrides the
hovered status with a checked theme color or `none`.
Core `image` accepts checked `label=` and `description=` text. A labeled image
is an AccessKit `Image`; an unlabeled image is decorative, and a description
without a label is rejected.
`viewer` wraps an image path or handle in iced's stateful zoom/pan widget. It
accepts width, height, fit, filter, non-negative padding, positive minimum and
maximum scales, and a positive scale step; the minimum cannot exceed the
maximum. Dynamic numeric values are bounded to their documented finite ranges,
and dynamic viewer scale bounds are ordered before reaching iced's pan/zoom
clamp. The widget owns gesture state in iced's tree, so no app state or event
handler is needed:

```ice
viewer memory_image w=fill h=240.0 fit=contain filter=nearest p=8.0 min-scale=0.5 max-scale=8.0 scale-step=0.1
```
Every `length` position accepts fixed `f64`, `fill`, `fill(N)` portions with a
decimal `u16`, `shrink`, or a checked first-class `length` expression;
out-of-range compact portions fail during parsing. Grid width and the short
axis of a horizontal/vertical slider remain fixed pixels because those iced
builders accept `Pixels`, not `Length`.
`rule` exposes all four iced fill modes. Percent is checked in `0.0..=100.0`;
padding is `u16`. Its default/weak preset can be overridden by a checked theme
color token (including `/0..100` opacity), uniform or per-corner non-negative
radius, and bool pixel snapping.
`qr` takes its payload as its first expression: a `str` or `bytes` value, most
often a literal but equally a state field holding a link minted at runtime.
Normal versions are `1..=40`, micro versions are `1..=4`, and omitted correction
uses iced's medium default. A QR view accepts one of `cell-size=` or `size=`
plus checked cell/background colors. A literal payload is encoded during
checking, so one that cannot fit the requested version and correction fails the
build; a payload that is only known at runtime cannot be, and the widget draws
nothing when its matrix does not fit. The matrix is built where the widget is
rendered rather than once at startup, because the payload is an expression and a
matrix cached in application state would outlive its own input.
Tooltip gap/padding are non-negative `f64`, delay is non-negative `i64`
milliseconds, and snap is bool.

The consuming Rust crate must enable iced's `image-without-codecs` or `image`
feature for `image` and `svg` for `svg`. Raster
decoder features remain a Cargo choice; the reference app enables only the PNM
decoder used by its tiny checked-in sample.

Mouse routes do not carry a payload. `cursor=` accepts the iced interaction
names in kebab case: `none`, `hidden`, `idle`, `context-menu`, `help`,
`pointer`, `progress`, `wait`, `cell`, `crosshair`, `text`, `alias`, `copy`,
`move`, `no-drop`, `not-allowed`, `grab`, `grabbing`, `resize-horizontal`,
`resize-vertical`, `resize-diagonal-up`, `resize-diagonal-down`,
`resize-column`, `resize-row`, `all-scroll`, `zoom-in`, and `zoom-out`.

`hover` is the DRAW-TIME hover container: exactly two children — the base,
then a reveal drawn (and interactive) only while the cursor is over the
widget — with `tint=` painted under both while hovered. No application state
is involved: hovering dispatches no messages and rebuilds nothing, so a
cached `lazy` row keeps a hover toolbar at native latency. Prefer it over
`mouse enter=`/`exit=` routes whenever the hover only changes what is DRAWN;
the routes remain for hover state the application itself must know.

`open=` (a `bool`) holds the reveal up whatever the cursor is doing. Pass it
whenever a control INSIDE the reveal opens something that outlives the hover
— a menu, a picker, a confirm — using that thing's own openness. Without it
the trigger disappears the moment the pointer moves and the popover is left
floating over nothing, pointing at a button that is no longer there.

The mouse `move=` route is the exception and receives `(x:f64, y:f64)` in
local widget coordinates. `press-at=` receives the same `(x:f64, y:f64)` local
position once per left press — and, unlike every other mouse route, fires even
when a child widget captured the press, so a click on a nested button still
reports where it landed. Prefer it over streaming `move=` into state when the
position is only read at interaction time: `move=` republishes on every cursor
pixel and rebuilds the view each time. `scroll=` receives
`(x:f64, y:f64, pixels:bool)`; `pixels=false` identifies iced line units. Bare
handler names receive these payloads automatically.

`scroll` accepts every native direction, all four iced length variants, visible
or hidden scrollbars, scrollbar dimensions/spacing, axis anchors, and bool
auto-scroll. Its `scroll=` handler receives absolute x/y followed by relative
x/y as four f64 payloads. `viewport=` is the complete alternative and receives
14 f64 values in this order: absolute x/y, reversed absolute x/y, relative x/y,
viewport x/y/width/height, then content x/y/width/height. The two routes are
mutually exclusive. Bare handler names receive every payload automatically.

`style=task_scroll(loading)` may call a declared `scroll-style`. Its Rust
function receives `&iced::Theme`, the current `scrollable::Status`, then its
owned arguments and returns `scrollable::Style`.

Optional `active`, `hovered`, and `dragged` lines expose every concrete
scrollable Style field: its container, both rails and scrollers, corner gap,
and auto-scroll overlay. Bool selectors match iced's horizontal/vertical
hovered, dragged, and disabled status fields. Omitted selectors are wildcards;
the `active` line applies first as the shared base, then matching hovered or
dragged lines apply in source order after the typed callback:

```ice
scroll dir=both viewport=viewport_changed style=task_scroll(loading)
  col
    text "Scrollable"
  active
    box bg=bg
    x-scroller bg=primary
    y-scroller bg=primary
    auto bg=surface icon=fg
  hovered x-hovered=true
    x-scroller bg=fg
  dragged y-dragged=true
    y-scroller bg=danger
```

`text` accepts str, i64, and f64 values plus typed width/height, positive size,
relative `line-h=` or absolute `line-h-px=`, horizontal and vertical
alignment, shaping, wrapping, and declared or built-in fonts.
`font=mono @font-semibold` preserves both choices. Weight utilities select
exact iced weights: `font-medium` is 500, `font-semibold` is 600, and
`font-bold` is 700.

`tracking=` is letter spacing in pixels, as a non-negative number literal — not
an expression, because it decides how the text is lowered. iced carries no
letter spacing (`iced::advanced::text` has no such field), so a tracked text
becomes one text widget per grapheme cluster inside a row whose spacing is the
tracking, and the properties that describe the run as a whole — `w=`, `h=`,
`align-x=`, `align-y=` — move to a container around that row. Absent tracking,
and `tracking=0.0`, emit exactly the untracked single-widget text.

That lowering discards shaping and kerning between graphemes, so `tracking=` is
only correct for short uppercase latin runs — the design-system convention it
exists for. The checker rejects what it can prove is broken by it: a non-ASCII
string literal is `E175`. It cannot prove anything about a runtime value, which
stays the author's contract; splitting is by grapheme cluster rather than by
`char` so a combining mark or emoji sequence is at least never torn apart. The
run also has no line, so `wrap=` and `align-x=justified` are `E174`, as is
`style=`, whose closure a tracked text would have to repeat per grapheme —
color a tracked label with a `@text-*` utility instead. Unlike CSS
`letter-spacing`, tracking adds no trailing space after the last grapheme. A
tracked run is not mouse-selectable because it is a row rather than the single
text paragraph required by the selection widget; its accessibility value is
still the complete unsplit text.

`input` keeps its required `str` binding and additionally supports checked
`label=`/`description=` accessibility text, bool secure mode, submit routes,
str-payload change/paste routes, typed width/padding/text size, relative line height,
horizontal alignment, complete font descriptors, and a complete text-input
icon. Its five optional status lines expose every concrete iced text-input Style
field. Without `change=`, typing writes the bound state directly. With
`change=handler _`, the handler receives the new text and owns that assignment,
which lets one state transition also launch validation or autosave. A disabled
input suppresses typing, submit, paste, and accessibility focus together. The
canonical icon form is the `icon` child block shown below. Removed inline
`icon=`, `icon-font=`, `icon-size=`, `icon-gap=`, and `icon-side=` spellings are
errors; there is no compatibility alias.

```ice
input "Search" #query <-> query hint="Find anything" font=ui
  active bg=surface border=border icon=primary placeholder=muted value=fg selection=primary
  focused-hovered bg=surface border=primary border-w=2.0 r=8.0
  disabled bg=bg border=border value=muted
  icon code="⌕" font=ui size=14.0 gap=6.0 side=left
```

`style=form_input(disabled)` may call a declared `input-style`. Its Rust
function receives `&iced::Theme`, the current `text_input::Status`, then its
owned arguments and returns `text_input::Style`. Checked utilities apply next,
and status lines are the final overrides.

`button` accepts either its compact string label or exactly one arbitrary child
node. The compact string is its default accessible name; child content requires
an explicit checked `label=`, and either form may add `description=`. It also
supports typed width/height, non-negative padding, bool clipping, disabled
routes, all eight iced presets, and checked style utilities. Text size,
line-height, family, and weight utilities style the generated text of a compact
string label. Arbitrary child content owns its own typography, so those button
utilities do not cascade into child nodes. Optional `active`,
`hovered`, `pressed`, and `disabled` child lines override every concrete button
style field with solid/linear backgrounds, text, per-corner border, shadow, and
pixel snapping. A structured content node may appear beside these status lines.

`style=action_button(loading)` may instead call a declared `button-style`.
Its Rust function receives `&iced::Theme`, the current `button::Status`, then
its declared owned arguments and returns `button::Style`. Ice installs it as
the native runtime style callback; utilities and status lines still override
that returned base style.

`checkbox` and `toggler` share typed control size/width/spacing, text size and
relative line height, shaping, wrapping, and default/mono font properties.
Togglers add full text alignment. Checkboxes use their visible label as the
default accessible name and accept checked `label=` and `description=`
overrides. They also add a single-character icon with size, relative line
height, and shaping. A checkbox may start from any of iced's primary,
secondary, success, or danger presets and override each checked and unchecked
form of its active, hovered, and disabled statuses independently:

```ice
checkbox "Complete" checked=done style=success -> changed _
  active checked bg=linear(1.57, primary@0.0, surface@1.0) icon=fg text=fg border=primary border-w=1.0 r=4.0
  active unchecked bg=surface icon=primary border=border
  hovered checked bg=primary icon=fg border=fg
  hovered unchecked bg=bg icon=primary border=primary
  disabled checked bg=surface icon=muted text=muted border=border
  disabled unchecked bg=bg icon=muted text=muted border=border
```

`style=task_checkbox(loading)` may instead call a declared `checkbox-style`.
Its Rust function receives `&iced::Theme`, the current `checkbox::Status`, then
its declared owned arguments and returns `checkbox::Style`. Status lines still
override the returned base style.

Each status starts from the selected preset, applies its matching `active
checked|unchecked` line, then applies the more-specific hovered or disabled
line. Listed solid/linear background, icon/text color, border color, width, and
uniform/per-corner radius fields override that base. Metrics are checked
non-negative f64 expressions.

A toggler uses the same six checked-aware status selectors and the same active
checked/unchecked base cascade. Each line may override every concrete field:

```ice
toggler "Notifications" checked=enabled -> changed _
  active checked bg=linear(1.57, primary@0.0, surface@1.0) bg-border=primary bg-border-w=1.0 fg=fg fg-border=border fg-border-w=1.0 text=fg r=8.0 p-ratio=0.125
  active unchecked bg=surface fg=fg text=muted
  hovered checked bg=primary fg=fg text=fg
  hovered unchecked bg=bg fg=primary text=fg
  disabled checked bg=surface fg=muted text=muted
  disabled unchecked bg=bg fg=muted text=muted
```

Background and foreground accept checked solid or linear values. Both borders,
optional uniform/per-corner radius, and text color map directly to
`toggler::Style`; widths and radii are non-negative, while `p-ratio=` is
checked in `0.0..=0.5` to keep the foreground dimensions non-negative.
`style=notification_toggler(loading)` may call a declared `toggler-style` whose
Rust function receives `&iced::Theme`, `toggler::Status`, then its owned
arguments and returns `toggler::Style`. Status lines override that base.

`slider` accepts `f64` or one extern named numeric type consistently across its
value, range, step, optional default, and optional shift step. The route carries
that exact type. `f64` steps are statically positive and literal defaults stay
inside literal ranges. A generic slider supplies an explicit same-type step;
generated Rust verifies iced's native `Copy`, `From<u8>`, `PartialOrd`,
`Into<f64>`, and `FromPrimitive` bounds. A zero-field extern declaration can
name a Rust numeric alias without exposing fake fields:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  SliderNumber()
  sync slider_number(value:f64) -> SliderNumber

state
  precise:SliderNumber = slider_number(50.0)

on precise_changed(next)
  precise = next

view
  slider precise min=slider_number(0.0) max=slider_number(100.0) step=slider_number(0.5) -> precise_changed _
```

The optional default handles command/control-click reset and an optional release
route reports interaction completion. Horizontal
sliders accept any length for width and fixed height; vertical sliders accept
fixed width and any length for height. For `f64`, literal reversed ranges and
invalid defaults are rejected before code generation; fluid cross-axis sizes
are rejected for every slider type.

A slider may own one nested `active`, `hovered`, and `dragged` style block.
`style=volume_slider(loading)` may call a declared `slider-style` whose Rust
function receives `&iced::Theme`, `slider::Status`, then its owned arguments
and returns `slider::Style`. Every status starts from that callback result, or
iced's default style, applies the `active` block, then its hovered or dragged
delta. Blocks override any listed rail backgrounds/width/border/radius or
handle shape/background/border.
Rail and handle backgrounds accept checked solid or linear values; borders stay
checked theme colors. Rectangle widths are `u16`; every other metric is a
non-negative f64. Handle corner radii require a rectangle handle in the same
status block.

`progress` supports all iced length variants for its main `length` and cross-axis
`girth`, horizontal or vertical direction, and primary/secondary/success/warning/
danger presets. Checked solid or linear backgrounds can override the track and
filled bar; a checked theme color overrides the border. Border width and
uniform/per-corner radii are non-negative f64 values.
Literal reversed ranges are rejected before generation; dynamic ranges are
converted to finite `f32`, ordered, and used to bound the current value before
the native constructor.

A declared progress style call may replace the preset while keeping those
field overrides:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  progress-style loading_progress(active:bool)

progress amount style=loading_progress(loading) bar=primary
```

Its Rust function receives the current `&iced::Theme` before its declared
owned arguments and returns `iced::widget::progress_bar::Style`. Ice installs
it as the native runtime style callback, which is also the default Theme's
advanced class representation.

`radio` accepts bool, i64, f64, str, or extern values and sends that typed value
to its route. `selected=` remains an explicit bool expression, so groups can use
any selection model without requiring a second optional state. The backend uses
a private bool as iced's `Eq + Copy` radio identity and puts the original owned
Ice value in the generated message; string and extern values therefore keep the
same click semantics without pretending they are Rust `Copy` types.

Size, every width `Length`, spacing, text size, relative line height, shaping,
wrapping, and complete font descriptors map to the corresponding radio setters.
Four optional `active|hovered × selected|unselected` child lines override every
concrete field. Hovered styles inherit the matching active selected/unselected
base:

```ice
radio "Summary" value="summary" selected=(mode == "summary") size=18.0 w=fill font=ui -> mode_changed _
  active selected bg=linear(1.57, primary@0.0, surface@1.0) dot=fg border=primary border-w=2.0 text=fg
  active unselected bg=surface dot=primary border=border text=muted
  hovered selected bg=primary dot=fg border=fg text=fg
  hovered unselected bg=bg dot=primary border=primary text=fg
```

Background accepts checked solid or linear values; dot, border, and text are
checked colors, and border width is a non-negative f64 expression.
`style=view_radio(loading)` may call a declared `radio-style` whose Rust
function receives `&iced::Theme`, `radio::Status`, then its owned arguments and
returns `radio::Style`. Status lines override that returned base.

`tooltip` styles start from transparent, rounded, bordered, dark, primary,
secondary, success, warning, or danger iced container presets. A checked solid
or linear background plus theme colors can override the preset's background,
text, border, and shadow. Border width, shadow
blur, and uniform/per-corner radii are non-negative f64 values; shadow x/y may
be negative. `px-snap=` controls the box style's pixel-grid snap and is
separate from the tooltip overlay's viewport `snap=` behavior.

`box border-dash=(on, off, ...)` draws the border as a dash pattern in pixels.
`iced::Border` is colour, width and radius only, so a dashed border cannot be
part of the surface quad: the dash lowers to a canvas stroke layered over the
box, using the same `border=` colour, `border-w=` width and uniform or
per-corner radius the solid border would have used. It replaces that solid
border rather than adding to it, and it changes no layout — the box is the base
layer of the stack it is drawn in, so the stack measures exactly the box. The
stroke is inset by half the border width and its corners are tightened by the
same inset, the way a CSS inner border is. Segments are non-negative `f64`, at
least one must be positive, and an odd sequence repeats once to form complete
on/off pairs on every renderer. A dynamically computed all-zero pattern draws
nothing. The colour has to be named by `border=` (`E176`), because that is the
colour the stroke draws. A box without `border-dash=` emits byte-identical code
to one that never knew about dashes. A declared
`box-style` call may replace the preset because iced uses the same
`container::Style` callback for tooltip surfaces; concrete tooltip properties
override the callback result.

`pick` requires a homogeneous `[T]` options expression and a matching optional
`T?` selection. Its main route carries `T`; `open=` and `close=` routes carry no
payload. Pick values may be bool, i64, f64, str, or an extern type. Fixed
width/menu height, padding, text size, relative line height, complete font
descriptors, and shaping map directly to iced's setters. All concrete field
styles are structured children: `active`, `hovered`, `opened`, and
`opened-hovered` cover the field statuses, while `menu` covers its overlay.
Every field status starts from iced's status default and the `active` base;
`opened-hovered` additionally inherits `opened`. Lines accept checked
solid/linear backgrounds, colors, border/per-corner radius, and menu shadow fields.
`style=view_picker(loading)` and `menu-style=view_menu(loading)` may instead
start from declared native callbacks; the structured status and menu fields
remain final overrides.

```ice
pick modes mode hint="Choose" font=ui shape=advanced style=view_picker(loading) menu-style=view_menu(loading) -> changed _
  active text=fg placeholder=muted handle=primary bg=surface border=border r=6.0
  opened-hovered text=fg bg=bg border=primary
  menu text=fg selected-text=fg selected-bg=primary bg=surface shadow=black/50 shadow-y=4.0
  handle dynamic
    closed code="⌄" font=ui size=12.0
    open code="⌃" font=ui size=12.0 shape=advanced
```

Handles support iced's arrow with optional size, one static icon, distinct
closed/open dynamic icons, or no handle. Icon code points contain exactly one
Unicode scalar; icon size and relative line height are non-negative `f64`.

`combo` requires a `combo[T]` search state and matching `T?` selection. Its
main and `hover=` routes carry `T`; `input=` carries str; `open=` and `close=`
carry no payload. A bare input/hover handler name receives the payload
automatically. Width/menu height, padding, text size, relative line height,
shaping, and complete fonts map to every native builder setter. A structured
`icon` line covers the complete text-input icon: one Unicode scalar, font,
size, spacing, and side.

The five `active`, `hovered`, `focused`, `focused-hovered`, and `disabled`
lines expose every concrete input Style field. Every status inherits `active`,
and `focused-hovered` additionally inherits `focused`. The shared `menu` line
exposes every menu overlay Style field:
`style=form_input(loading)` reuses the native `input-style` ABI, and
`menu-style=view_menu(loading)` reuses the same menu callback as `pick`.
Structured lines override both callback results.

```ice
combo modes mode "Search views" font=ui shape=advanced style=form_input(loading) menu-style=view_menu(loading) -> changed _
  active bg=surface border=border icon=primary placeholder=muted value=fg selection=primary
  focused-hovered bg=bg border=primary border-w=2.0 r=6.0
  menu text=fg selected-text=fg selected-bg=primary bg=surface shadow=black/50
  icon code="⌕" font=ui size=14.0 gap=6.0 side=right
```

Assigning a matching `[T]` to `combo[T]` state replaces its searchable options
with a freshly indexed native `combo_box::State<T>`. `combo modes push value`
calls native `State::push` to incrementally add one matching option and rebuild
its search index. Mismatched lists or pushed values fail before Rust generation.

`float` applies positive scale and x/y translation to one child. Its x/y
expressions can use the scoped `f64` names `original_x`, `original_y`,
`original_width`, `original_height`, `viewport_x`, `viewport_y`,
`viewport_width`, and `viewport_height` from iced's translation callback:

```ice
float scale=1.02 x=(viewport_width - original_width) y=-1.0 shadow=black/50 shadow-y=2.0 shadow-blur=4.0 r=4.0
  text "Floating label"
```

The shadow color, offset, blur, and uniform/per-corner radius properties cover
every concrete `float::Style` field. The scoped geometry names exist only in
`x=` and `y=`; style expressions and the child use the surrounding scope.
`pin` places one child at x/y coordinates inside optional typed width/height
bounds; x/y is the direct decomposition of iced's `position(Point)` helper.
`sensor` observes one child: show/resize handlers receive `(width:f64,
height:f64)`, while hide has no payload; anticipation is non-negative f64 and
delay is non-negative i64 milliseconds. `key=` owns a comparable Ice value and
provides the same continuity behavior as iced's borrowed `key_ref` form.
`responsive at=N` chooses its first child below width N and its second child
otherwise. The general `responsive size=(width, height)` form binds the current
iced `Size` as two scoped `f64` names and accepts one arbitrary child tree, so
conditions and component inputs can depend on either dimension.

`theme` applies an iced theme to exactly one child subtree. With no preset or
`default`, iced chooses the default theme for the outer light/dark mode; `app`
reuses the app's generated custom palette. Every iced built-in theme is accepted
in kebab case, such as `dark`, `catppuccin-mocha`, or `tokyo-night-storm`.
Checked `fg=` and solid or linear `bg=` values override the subtree
defaults.

`stack` accepts every iced `Length` for width and height. Its first rendered
child normally determines intrinsic size. `under=N` places the first N rendered
children beneath that base without letting them determine intrinsic size,
matching iced's `push_under`; values larger than the rendered child count simply
leave the stack without an intrinsic base layer.

`row` and `col` accept typed spacing, every iced `Length` for width/height,
cross-axis `start`/`center`/`end` alignment, and clipping. Columns additionally
accept `max-w=`. Padding can be uniform, axis-specific, or per-side; the
more specific value wins regardless of property order. Bare `wrap` switches to
iced's wrapping layout. `wrap-gap=` controls spacing between wrapped rows or
columns and `wrap-align=` controls their main-axis placement; both require
`wrap`. Non-wrapping rows and columns bound child fill factors so iced's native
`u16` sum cannot overflow.

`flex` uses Ice's native flexbox runtime. It supports `dir`, `flow`, `wrap`,
`justify`, `items`, `content`, axis-specific gaps, sizing, padding, and
clipping. A direct `box` child can set `order`, `grow`, `shrink`, `basis`,
`self`, and uniform/axis/per-side `m` margins, including `auto` and
`percent(N)`. `flex=none|auto|initial|grow[,shrink[,basis]]` is the compact
item form.

`keyed item in items by=key` is iced's identity-preserving column. `items` must
be a list, `key` is checked in the item scope and must be bool, i64, or f64,
and the indented node is the single repeated child template. Each child also
receives an automatic `key(...)` identity scope. Keyed columns accept every
native keyed-column setter: spacing, uniform/axis/per-side padding, every
`Length` for width and height, max width, and cross-axis alignment. Repeated
child fill factors are bounded against the rendered item count so the native
`u16` sum cannot overflow.

`lazy dependency as cached` rebuilds its one child subtree only when the
dependency hash changes. The subtree also survives unmounting: when a `match`
arm switch or a trimmed list tears the mount down, the built widget state is
parked, and a later remount with an unchanged dependency rehydrates it instead
of rebuilding and re-shaping — a screen switch pays only for content that
actually changed. The dependency may be bool, i64, str, an extern type
implementing Rust `Hash + Clone`, or a recursive list/optional of those. Only
the owned `cached` alias is visible inside the subtree as a value, which
statically enforces iced's `Element<'static>` contract. The enclosing `for`
scope is not visible either: the subtree is built from its dependency alone, so
it carries no iteration index and every row of a `lazy` list otherwise renders
under one runtime id. A `lazy` inside a `for` therefore needs an `id` derived
from the row — `#market(market.name)` — or its rows are indistinguishable to
targets, captures, and the accessibility tree. Input, combo, named QR data, and
a slot from an enclosing component are rejected because those forms borrow
app-owned data. Components and structured children remain usable when
their complete expanded tree satisfies the same static rule. The enclosing
component's routing context is preserved: routes inside the subtree resolve
the component's own handlers, and `forward` and `emit` deliver component
events and outputs exactly as they do outside `lazy`. A component event or
output delivered from inside a `lazy` subtree is captured by the closure as an
owned callback, so every call-site route for it — through any `forward` or
`emit` chain — accepts only `_` payloads; an expression there would freeze a
stale value or borrow view state.

Markdown content is parsed into owned iced state instead of being reparsed by
the view. A literal initializes it directly, `markdown(source)` replaces it,
`markdown state append source` incrementally extends it, and
`markdown_images(state)` returns every referenced image URI as `[str]`:

```ice
state
  help:markdown = "# Help [docs](https://iced.rs)"
  images:[str] = []

on open_link(url)
on extend
  markdown help append "\n\n![Ice](asset://ice)"
  images = markdown_images(help)

view
  markdown help text-size=16.0 gap=12.0 -> open_link _
    style font=ui inline-code-bg=surface inline-code-fg=fg inline-code-font=mono code-block-font=mono link=primary inline-code-p=3.0 inline-code-border=border inline-code-border-w=1.0 inline-code-r=4.0
```

The route receives the clicked URI as str. `text-size`, every h1-h6 size,
`code-size`, and `spacing` map directly to iced Markdown `Settings`; sizes must
be positive and spacing non-negative. The nested `style` line covers every
field in iced Markdown `Style`: base, inline-code, and code-block fonts;
inline-code highlight background, padding, text color, and full border; and
link color. Uniform, axis, per-side padding and uniform/per-corner radius use
the most specific supplied value. The reference app enables iced's Markdown
parser and syntax highlighter features.

A table iterates a typed list and gives every cell its row binding. Headers and
cells are arbitrary one-root Ice subtrees:

```ice
table task in tasks w=fill px=8.0 sep=1.0
  col w=fill align-x=left align-y=center
    header
      text "Task" @font-bold
    cell
      text task.title
```

Table width accepts every iced `Length`. Uniform/horizontal/vertical padding
and separator thickness are non-negative pixels. Each column accepts every
`Length` width plus all horizontal and vertical alignments; fill factors are
bounded across both columns and rows so their native `u16` sums cannot
overflow. Row and column identity scopes are generated automatically, so IDs
inside repeated cells do not collide. Rust row values must be `Clone`, matching
iced's table contract.

Text editor content is another owned UI state type. A literal initializes it,
and `editor(source)` replaces it from a runtime str:

```ice
state
  notes:editor = "fn main() {}"

view
  editor #notes <-> notes hint="Write notes" w=640.0 h=fill min-h=80.0 max-h=240.0 size=14.0 line-h=1.3 p=8.0 wrap=word font=mono highlight="rs" highlight-theme=base16-ocean disabled=loading
    active bg=surface border=border placeholder=muted value=fg selection=primary
    focused-hovered bg=surface border=primary border-w=2.0 r=8.0
    disabled bg=bg border=border value=muted
```

The compiler owns iced's `Action` message variant and calls `Content::perform`
automatically. `action=name()` instead delegates that update to an
`editor-action name()` adapter with the exact Rust signature
`fn(&mut text_editor::Content, text_editor::Action)`; the adapter must perform
the action itself and is intended for native history or telemetry that must see
edits without cloning the document.
Width is fixed pixels, height accepts every iced `Length`, metrics are
range-checked, and all four wrapping modes, declared or built-in fonts,
relative/absolute line height, and all five iced highlighter themes are
accepted. Optional status lines cover every concrete Style field for active,
hovered, focused, focused-hovered, and disabled editors. A disabled editor is
rendered without `on_action`.

The remaining native extension points are typed:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  EditorCommand(save:bool)
  editor-binding editor_keys(readonly:bool) -> EditorCommand
  editor-action track_edits()
  editor-highlighter editor_highlight(token:str)
  editor-style editor_surface(readonly:bool)

component EditorPanel(bind content:editor, readonly:bool)
  editor <-> content action=track_edits() highlighter=editor_highlight("fn") key-binding=editor_keys(readonly) style=editor_surface(readonly) -> editor_command _
```

`editor-binding` receives iced's `KeyPress` implicitly and returns an optional
native `Binding<EditorCommand>`; built-in edit bindings stay native while
`Binding::Custom` is mapped through the checked route. `editor-highlighter`
receives the fully configured plain-text `TextEditor` and returns a value
convertible to the same default `Element`, so Rust can call `highlight_with`
with any `Highlighter`, settings, highlight type, and format function. Stock
Iced editor formats can vary color and font. Mixed metrics, span backgrounds,
visual-line backgrounds, and shared rich hit-test geometry require a custom
widget such as `ui_lang_runtime::RichTextEditor`.
Large fixed-height collections use `ui_lang_runtime::VirtualListState` and the
feature-gated `ducktape_ui::ui::virtual_list` typed boundary. Stable unique keys
reconcile selection across reorder/delete, while native focus, pointer selection,
Up/Down/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown, scroll-to-item, visible-range inspection, and
named AccessKit list/item metadata remain runtime behavior. Visible and mounted
range queries derive from the current item count, measured native viewport, and
scroll offset. Native layout changes emit the typed `ViewportChanged` event;
revisioned private operations synchronize programmatic state to the native
scrollable on first layout, remount, and absolute offset zero without a
caller-owned Iced task. Public keys require `Clone + Eq + Hash`, so owned domain
identifiers do not require interning. An
application mounts the widget in a bounded-height parent that does not scroll it
vertically; `VirtualList` owns its native vertical scrolling. Arbitrary standard
Iced scrolling ancestors are outside the v1 pointer contract when they translate
or clip the list on a hit-test axis. Iced 0.14 retains raw window-coordinate
touch positions while translating only cursor and replacement viewport data, and
does not expose the lost ancestor transform to the descendant. Ordinary
non-scrolling layout parents remain supported; nested scrolling requires a
future explicit coordinate-context contract rather than inferred geometry. An
explicit `VirtualListId` combines a readable logical name with a runtime-unique
namespace; identity and retained state are not clonable, while explicit `fork`
requires a new logical name and copies retained data into a new namespace
instead of aliasing it. Logical names must be unique among concurrently mounted
lists so headless selectors are exact. Separate `VirtualListId::new` calls with
duplicate logical names violate that selector contract, but their runtime-unique
namespaces still prevent native widget and AccessKit identity collisions.
The collection selector comes from `VirtualListId::selector`, and reconciled
row selectors come from `VirtualListState::item_selector`; callers do not
reconstruct either from the readable logical name. Canonical UTF-8 percent
escaping and separate reserved list/item namespaces prevent a logical name that
resembles a row path from aliasing another semantic target.
`update_snapshot` preserves identity only for value-oriented reducer replacement
and its old snapshot may not remain mounted. Its immutable per-key semantic map
is shared in constant time; only successful explicit reconciliation publishes a
new complete map. Retained
per-key semantic allocations remain distinct even when
different keys produce the same hash. Only mounted visible-plus-overscan rows
become Elements. Native scrollbar and interactive-child mouse, touch, and cursor
behavior take precedence over row selection. Touch ownership uses the pressed
and lifted event positions translated through the list's owned native scroll
offset, clipped to its owned viewport, plus descendant capture before and after
dispatch, independently of the current mouse cursor. Trees for
keys in consecutive mounted-window intersections
remain retained. The focused AccessKit list exposes its selected mounted item as
the active descendant. `VirtualList.Frame`
is an Ice composition around an app-owned extern component; there is deliberately
no `virtual-for` syntax, variable-height measurement, or nested vertical-scroll
contract in v1. Accessibility v1
focuses and navigates the collection but does not create offscreen item nodes or
per-item accessibility actions.

Hierarchical fixed-row collections use `ui_lang_runtime::TreeViewState` and the
feature-gated `ducktape_ui::ui::tree_view` boundary on that same native
collection engine. Callers reconcile unique keyed nodes in preorder, with each
parent preceding a contiguous child subtree and marked `has_children`; invalid
duplicate, missing, later, leaf, or already-closed parents reject the complete
reconciliation atomically.
Expansion is retained by key. Right expands a branch or enters its first child,
Left collapses it or selects its parent, and collapse rehomes hidden selection
to the collapsed ancestor. Expanding an unloaded branch returns a typed
load-request key. Rename initiation is an explicit caller action that sends
typed rename state; the caller focuses its editor and routes text changes,
submit, and cancel through the typed rename events, then runs the tree focus
task after removing the editor. The tree does not intercept
keys owned by another focused control. `drag_target` classifies pointer geometry
as before, inside, or after a visible row. AccessKit exposes a named Tree with
mounted TreeItem nodes carrying stable
identity, one-based level, sibling position and size, selection, and expansion.
`TreeView.Frame` composes an app-owned typed extern; v1 remains fixed-height,
caller-flattened, and outside Core syntax.

Large fixed-row tabular surfaces use `ui_lang_runtime::DataGridState` and the
feature-gated `ducktape_ui::ui::data_grid` boundary. Callers reconcile unique
typed row keys and unique fixed-pixel typed columns. Successful reconciliation
atomically publishes constant-time row and column indexes; stable row semantic
identity, the active cell, and its selected row follow keys across reorder.
Only visible rows plus overscan are materialized, while every fixed column is
mounted for each mounted row. The grid owns native horizontal and vertical
scrolling in a bounded parent and exposes both axes, mounted ranges and counts,
selection, edit target, and logical dimensions through headless inspection.

Arrow keys navigate cells, Home/End navigate a row, Ctrl/Cmd+Home and
Ctrl/Cmd+End navigate the complete grid, and PageUp/PageDown use the measured
viewport. Navigation reveals its destination. Sort activation returns a typed
column key and leaves direction, row ordering, and data mutation to the caller.
F2, Enter, and double click can begin an editable cell, but the caller owns the
draft and committed value, mounts and focuses a native editor, and returns focus
to the grid after commit or cancellation. Descendant controls handle events
first, so the grid does not intercept their IME or text-editing protocol.
AccessKit exposes a named Grid, a mounted header Row and ColumnHeader nodes, and
mounted data Row and Cell nodes with total counts, one-based indexes, selected
state, caller-supplied sort direction, and an active descendant for a mounted
active cell. `DataGrid.Frame` composes the typed extern. V1 excludes variable
row heights, resizable or virtualized columns, range selection, and Core
syntax; it does not extend the small-data `Table` or `DataTableState` helpers.

`editor-style` receives Theme and editor Status implicitly and returns native
`text_editor::Style`, covering the advanced catalog class. An editor or input
inside a component may bind only a prop declared with `bind`. Every call passes
it explicitly with `content<->state`; the state must be a direct app state,
component-local state, or another `bind` prop. Ordinary `name:type` props are
read-only, and computed temporary bindings are rejected.
`key-binding=` and the editor's outer `->` route must appear together; an
editor without a custom binding has neither.

Pure editor inspection uses `editor_cursor_line(editor)`,
`editor_cursor_column(editor)`, `editor_line_count(editor)`,
`editor_has_selection(editor)`, and `editor_line(editor, line) -> str?`.
`editor_copy(editor)` preserves text and cursor in a fresh native Content when
an actual duplicate is needed. A sync self-assignment such as
`document = apply_command(document, command)` transfers the owned editor buffer
through the function without cloning it, so editing, undo, formatting, and
similar commands keep the same native buffer allocation.

Spaces inside a compound expression should be wrapped in parentheses when the
expression shares a line with widget properties:

```ice
button "Add" disabled=(loading || empty(trim(draft))) -> submit
```

| `event-status` | `iced::event::Status` |
| `task-handle` | `iced::task::Handle` |
| `Name` | the named struct in the extern namespace |
| `unit` | `()` |

One namespace keeps declarations short:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  Task(id:i64, title:str, done:bool)
  AppError(message:str)
  list_tasks() -> [Task] ! AppError
  create_task(title:str) -> [Task] ! AppError
```

This means:

```rust
crate::backend::Task
crate::backend::AppError
crate::backend::list_tasks
crate::backend::create_task
```

Bare extern functions are asynchronous. `A -> B` means `async fn(...) -> B`.
`A -> B ! E` means `async fn(...) -> Result<B, E>`. Values crossing into iced
messages must satisfy the traits required by generated iced code, notably
`Clone` for 2.0 message payloads. Generated app and message debug output is
opaque, so ordinary extern state and payload types do not additionally need to
implement `Debug`.

Declared `sync` functions are checked, synchronous Rust calls available in
Ice expressions. They are the small escape hatch for pure domain conversions
that do not justify a language builtin:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  NetworkError(message:str)
  AppError(message:str)
  sync normalize_error(error:NetworkError) -> AppError
```

This declaration requires
`fn normalize_error(NetworkError) -> AppError`; generated probes verify the
actual Rust signature. A sync function cannot declare `! Error` because it
returns its value directly.

Thirty-two typed iced adapters expose framework capabilities without embedding Rust
expressions in Ice:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  component native_help(active:bool) -> bool
  component borrowed_help(label:&str, active:&bool) -> bool
  selector by_kind(kind:str) -> str
  shader status_shader(speed:f64) -> bool
  task copy_text(text:str) -> unit
  stream task_steps(count:i64) -> i64
  sip download(url:str) progress=f64 -> bytes ! AppError
  recipe events(channel:i64) -> str
  event-filter runtime_event() -> str
  subscription app_events() -> bool
  theme app_theme(dark:bool)
  themer alternate_panel(active:bool) -> bool
  markdown-viewer docs_viewer(prefix:str) -> str
  editor-binding editor_keys(readonly:bool) -> EditorCommand
  editor-highlighter editor_highlight(token:str)
  editor-style editor_surface(readonly:bool)
  text-style summary_text(busy:bool)
  slider-style volume_slider(busy:bool)
  progress-style loading_progress(active:bool)
  button-style action_button(busy:bool)
  checkbox-style task_checkbox(busy:bool)
  toggler-style notification_toggler(busy:bool)
  radio-style view_radio(busy:bool)
  box-style summary_container(busy:bool)

  scroll-style task_scroll(active:bool)
  pick-list-style view_picker(active:bool)
  menu-style view_menu(active:bool)
  panes-style workspace_panes(active:bool)
```

Their Rust signatures are:

```rust
fn native_help(active: bool) -> iced::Element<'static, bool>;
fn borrowed_help<'a>(label: &'a str, active: &'a bool)
    -> iced::Element<'a, bool, iced::Theme, AppRenderer>;

    iced::Element<'static, bool, AlternateTheme>,
    Option<fn(&AlternateTheme) -> iced::Color>,
    Option<fn(&AlternateTheme) -> iced::Background>,
);
fn docs_viewer(prefix: String) -> impl for<'a> iced::widget::markdown::Viewer<'a, String>;
fn editor_keys(event: iced::widget::text_editor::KeyPress, readonly: bool) -> Option<iced::widget::text_editor::Binding<EditorCommand>>;
fn editor_highlight<'a, Message: 'a>(editor: iced::widget::text_editor::TextEditor<'a, iced::advanced::text::highlighter::PlainText, Message>, token: String) -> impl Into<iced::Element<'a, Message>>;
fn editor_surface(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::text_editor::Status, readonly: bool) -> iced::widget::text_editor::Style;
fn summary_text(theme: &iced::Theme, busy: bool) -> iced::widget::text::Style;
fn volume_slider(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::slider::Status, busy: bool) -> iced::widget::slider::Style;
fn loading_progress(theme: &iced::Theme, active: bool) -> iced::widget::progress_bar::Style;
fn action_button(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::button::Status, busy: bool) -> iced::widget::button::Style;
fn task_checkbox(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::checkbox::Status, busy: bool) -> iced::widget::checkbox::Style;
fn notification_toggler(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::toggler::Status, busy: bool) -> iced::widget::toggler::Style;
fn view_radio(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::radio::Status, busy: bool) -> iced::widget::radio::Style;

fn form_input(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::text_input::Status, disabled: bool) -> iced::widget::text_input::Style;
fn task_scroll(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::scrollable::Status, active: bool) -> iced::widget::scrollable::Style;
fn view_picker(theme: &iced::Theme, status: iced::widget::pick_list::Status, active: bool) -> iced::widget::pick_list::Style;
fn view_menu(theme: &iced::Theme, active: bool) -> iced::overlay::menu::Style;
fn workspace_panes(theme: &iced::Theme, active: bool) -> iced::widget::pane_grid::Style;
```

An extern component parameter without `&` is owned. `&str`, `&bytes`, and
`&[T]` lower to borrowed slices; any other `&T` parameter lowers to a shared
Rust reference. A component may therefore return `Element<'a, Event, Theme,
Renderer>` borrowing app state, while owned-only components may return
`Element<'static, Event, Theme, Renderer>`. Both use the app's configured
renderer. A shader factory returns any concrete
`shader::Program<Event>`; Ice constructs the native `Shader`, exposes its full
width/height builder API, and maps the program's published event through a
checked route:

```ice
shader status_shader(1.0) w=fill h=32.0 -> shader_hovered _
```

A selector factory returns any concrete `widget::selector::Selector`. Ice passes
its declared arguments, preserves its declared output type, and uses the result
with native `find` or `find_all`. The consumer must enable iced's `selector`
feature. Built-in selectors produce Ice's normalized `widget-target` value;
custom selectors should use ordinary declared output types.

A task returns `Task<Event>` or `Task<Result<Event, Error>>`. A stream returns
any static `Stream<Item = Event>` or `Stream<Item = Result<Event, Error>>` that
meets iced's platform send bound. A sip returns a static
`Sipper<Output, Progress>` or `Straw<Output, Progress, Error>`. A subscription
recipe factory returns a concrete `advanced::subscription::Recipe`. An event
filter receives iced's implicit runtime `Event` and optionally returns its
declared payload. A subscription adapter returns `Subscription<Event>`.
`theme` returns the concrete default-renderer `iced::Theme`; unlike value
externs, its return type is implicit and no `->` appears in Ice. Its checked
arguments may come from app state or the local component scope. The same
factory is valid in the app `theme` setting and around one nested subtree, so
Rust can construct `Theme::custom`, `Theme::custom_with_fn`, or any built-in
theme while retaining full `Palette` and `Extended` palette logic.
`themer` applies any Rust `Theme: iced::theme::Base` to a Rust-owned subtree
while the surrounding Ice app keeps its normal Theme. Its factory returns the
optional alternate Theme, an `Element` using that exact Theme type, and
optional Theme-dependent text color and background function pointers. The
generated probe verifies all four tuple fields use the same Theme type; the
view lowers through native `widget::themer`, applies both callbacks when
present, and maps the declared event through an ordinary checked route.

```ice
view
  themer alternate_panel(active) -> alternate_changed _
```

`markdown-viewer` returns one concrete viewer implementing iced's default-theme,
default-renderer `Viewer` for every item lifetime. `viewer=docs_viewer(args)`
switches the Markdown node to native `view_with`; its declared output type is
the checked route payload. The viewer owns customization of images, headings,
paragraphs, code blocks, lists, quotes, rules, and tables. `progress-style`
receives the current Theme implicitly and returns one native progress Style;
generated code uses it directly as the widget's runtime style callback.

`editor-binding` receives native `KeyPress` before its declared arguments and
returns `Option<Binding<Output>>`; `Output` is the custom route payload.
`editor-action` receives mutable native Content and the current Action and
returns unit.
`editor-highlighter` receives a fully configured plain `TextEditor` before its
declared arguments and returns any value convertible to the same default
`Element`; stock formats support color and font. Rich metrics and decorations
belong in a custom widget. `editor-style` receives Theme and native editor
Status implicitly.

`text-style` receives the current Theme implicitly and returns native
`text::Style`. Both `text ... style=summary_text(args)` and
`rich-text style=summary_text(args)` use it as a runtime callback. An explicit
rich-text `color=` or trailing `@text-*` utility overrides the callback color.
`button-style` also receives the current button Status and returns its native
Style. `checkbox-style`, `toggler-style`, and `radio-style` do the same for
their selection-aware widget Status values. `box-style` receives Theme
without a Status and returns its native surface Style. `svg-style` receives
Theme and the idle/hovered SVG Status and returns the native SVG Style.
`input-style` receives Theme and the current text-input Status and returns its
native Style. `scroll-style` receives Theme and the complete scrollable Status
and returns its native Style. `pick-list-style` does the same for pick-list
Status. `menu-style` receives Theme without a Status and returns the shared
pick-list/combo overlay menu Style. `panes-style` receives Theme without a
Status and returns the native panes Style; checked structured style fields
remain available as explicit overrides.

Generated probes type-check every declaration
against the actual Rust item. Extern component, shader, recipe, event-filter,
sync, selector, subscription, theme, themer, window, Markdown viewer, editor extension, and widget style declarations are
infallible; errors are ordinary event payloads when an adapter needs them.
Shader programs retain native control of `State`, `Primitive`, GPU
pipeline/storage, event actions, redraws, capture, and mouse interaction. The
consumer must enable iced's `wgpu` feature.

Struct declarations are read-only views of Rust data. Ice may read a declared
field (`task.title`) but cannot construct or mutate the struct. Declaring a
field or function does not create it; the generated Rust probes verify the
actual item and type.

## 6. State and expressions

Literal state types are inferred, including non-empty homogeneous lists:

```ice
state
  draft = ""
  loading = false
  retries = 0
  modes = ["List", "Board"]
```

These infer to `str`, `bool`, `i64`, and `[str]`, respectively.

Top-level `derived` declarations name pure read-only expressions over app state
and other derived values:

```ice
derived
  normalized_draft = trim(draft)
  can_submit = !loading && !empty(normalized_draft)
```

Derived values are available in app handlers and views. Their types are
inferred, dependency cycles are errors, and assignment or `<->` binding is
forbidden. Derived expressions use Ice built-ins and cannot call extern
functions. They lower to ordinary pure Rust getters and are recomputed when
read; Ice does not create a signal, cache, or runtime dependency graph.

Empty lists need an annotation because their element type is unknowable:

```ice
tasks:[Task] = []
selection:str? = none
search_modes:combo[str] = ["List", "Board"]
```

Native animation state keeps motion structured while iced remains in charge of
time and interpolation:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  sync elastic(value:f64) -> f64

state
  expanded:animation[bool] = false
    easing ease-in-out
    duration 400ms
    delay 50ms
    repeat 1
    auto-reverse true
  progress:animation[f64] = 0.0
    easing elastic
    duration quick

on open
  expanded = true
  progress = 1.0
```

The built-in state types are `bool` and `f64`; a named extern type is also
accepted when its Rust type implements iced's animation bounds. Every native
easing variant is accepted in kebab case. A different easing name
must resolve to `sync name(value:f64) -> f64`. Durations and delays accept whole
`ms`/`s` values, including zero; duration presets are `very-quick`, `quick`,
`slow`, and `very-slow`. `repeat N` preserves iced's meaning (one repetition
plays twice), while `repeat forever` and `auto-reverse true` map directly to the
native builders. Ice subscribes to native window frames only while at least one
animation is active.

The expression language contains:

- literals: strings, booleans, `i64`, `f64`, `none`, list literals such as
  `[]` and `["List", "Board"]`, and hexadecimal `bytes(00 ff ...)`;
- paths: `state_name`, `parameter`, `item.field`;
- unary operators: `!`, `-`;
- arithmetic: `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`;
- comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`;
- boolean operators: `&&`, `||`;
- parentheses;
- built-ins: `len(list_or_str_or_bytes) -> i64`,
  `empty(list_or_str_or_bytes) -> bool`, `trim(str) -> str`, `some(T) -> T?`,
  `ok(T) -> result[T,_]`, `err(E) -> result[_,E]`,
  `encoded(bytes) -> image`, `rgba(i64, i64, bytes) -> image`, and
  `aborted(task-handle?) -> bool`;
- namespaced keyboard built-ins such as `key.named("Enter")`,
  `key.code("KeyA")`, and `key.latin(logical, physical)`;
- native pointer built-ins such as `point(x, y)`, `mouse.button("left")`,
  `mouse.cursor(point)`, `mouse.click(point, button, previous)`, and
  `touch.finger("42")`;
- native geometry transformations such as `vector(x, y)`, `size(width, height)`,
  `point.distance(from, to)`, `rectangle.intersection(left, right)`,
  `transform.translate(x, y)`, `transform.compose(left, right)`, and
  `transform.point(point, transformation)`;
- native units such as `pixels(value)`, `padding.all(value)`, `degrees(value)`,
  and `radians(value)`;
- native rotation values with `rotation.default`, `floating`, `solid`, `from`,
  `with_radians`, and `apply`;
- native content fitting with all `fit.*` variants and `fit.apply`;
- native color values with `color.*` construction, conversion, parsing,
  mutation, luminance, contrast, and readability operations;
- native layout lengths with `length.*` variants, conversions, queries, and
  composition;
- native axis alignments with `alignment.*`, `horizontal.*`, and `vertical.*`;
- image allocation retention with `image.downgrade(allocation) -> image-memory`
  and `image.upgrade(memory) -> image-allocation?`;
- debug timing with `debug.active(span_state) -> bool` and
  `debug.time_with(name, value)`, preserving the value's checked type;
- animation queries `animation.value(state)`,
  `animation.animating(state[, at])`,
  `animation.interpolate(bool_state, start, end[, at])` for matching `f64` or
  `f64?` endpoints, and
  `animation.remaining(bool_state[, at])`; remaining time is returned in
  milliseconds independently of easing overshoot;
- checked projection
  `animation.project(state, value, expression[, at])`, where the expression
  sees the current inner value as `value` and returns `f64` or `f64?`;
- `markdown(str) -> markdown` and `markdown_images(markdown) -> [str]`;
- calls to declared typed `sync` extern functions.

Declared sync calls take precedence over ordinary built-ins. The name `bytes`
remains reserved for hexadecimal byte-literal syntax. If a sync declaration
shadows `encoded` or `rgba`, state initialized by that call needs an explicit
type because it is no longer a built-in literal constructor.

Store `encoded` and `rgba` handles in state so they are created when state
changes instead of on every view pass. Literal RGBA data is checked to contain
exactly `width × height × 4` bytes. Image widgets accept either a path string or
an `image` handle. A literal relative path — for `image`, `viewer`, `svg`, and
the canvas `image` and `svg` commands, exactly like `font` and `icon-rgba` — is a
compile-time asset: it resolves against the directory of the root `.ice` source,
a missing or unreadable file is `E192`, editing the file re-analyzes the root,
and its bytes are embedded in the binary, which therefore needs neither the
source tree nor a particular working directory. An absolute literal or a computed
path expression is a deliberate runtime reference instead: it is passed through
unchanged and loaded from the process filesystem when the view renders:

```ice
state
  logo = encoded(bytes(50 36 0a 31 20 31 0a 32 35 35 0a ff 00 ff))
  pixel = rgba(1, 1, bytes(ff 00 ff ff))

view
  image pixel crop=(0, 0, 1, 1)
```

Explicit allocation prevents the first-frame delay of lazily uploaded image
handles. Hold the returned allocation for as long as the guarantee is needed:

```ice
state
  handle:image = rgba(1, 1, bytes(ff 00 ff ff))
  allocation:image-allocation? = none
  failure:image-error? = none

on prepare
  task image allocate handle -> ready _ | failed _

on ready(value)
  allocation = some(value)

on failed(error)
  failure = some(error)
```

`image-allocation` exposes `.handle` and exact `.size:size-u32`; `size-u32`
exposes integer `.width` and `.height`. `image-error` preserves the native
value and exposes `.kind` (`invalid`, `inaccessible`, `unsupported`, `empty`,
or `out-of-memory`) plus its display `.message`. Downgrade/upgrade expose the
native weak-memory lifecycle. This task requires iced's `image` Cargo feature,
not only `image-without-codecs`.

Native debug spans have an explicit, ownership-safe state lifecycle:

```ice
state
  timer:debug-span? = none
  measured = 0

on begin
  debug start "interaction" -> timer

on finish
  debug finish timer

on compute
  measured = debug.time_with("compute", measured + 1)
```

`debug start` stores the exact `iced::debug::Span`; if the target already owns
a span, it is finished before replacement. `debug finish` takes and finishes
the span and is harmless when state is `none`. Because native spans are not
cloneable, `debug-span` is accepted only as `debug-span?` state and cannot cross
an extern, component, handler-message, collection, or ordinary assignment
boundary. Use `debug.active(state)` to read whether a span is present.
`debug.time_with` accepts a string name plus any non-span expression and returns
the expression's exact type. These calls always compile; iced's `debug` Cargo
feature activates reporting, while builds without it use iced's native no-op
spans.

There is no arbitrary Rust expression, method call, closure, general allocation
API, or implicit truthiness. New operations either belong in a small universal builtin
set or behind a typed extern function.

## 7. Handlers and effects

Handlers are the only place state changes:

```ice
on submit
  let title = trim(draft)
  return if loading || empty(title)
  loading = true
  run create_task(title) -> created _ | failed _
```

Rules:

- assignment targets must be declared state;
- `let` introduces one immutable handler-local value using the normal closed
  expression language; it cannot shadow state, derived values, parameters, or
  an earlier local;
- assigned expressions must have the state type;
- assigning the inner value of `animation[T]` starts its native transition at
  the current monotonic instant; `state = value at instant` supplies an exact
  `instant` instead;
- `combo state push value` requires a `combo[T]` state and a `T` value;
- `return if` requires `bool`;
- every statement that immediately returns an iced `Task` must be final:
  `exit`, `run`, `task`, `stream`, `sip`, `flow`, task groups, abortable tasks,
  clipboard writes, widget operations, window tasks, and pane queries;
- `return if` is a conditional guard, and pane mutations are synchronous state
  changes, so either may precede later statements;
- fallible externs require both success and error routes;
- infallible externs permit only the success route;
- parameter names are unique within each handler;
- handler parameter types are inferred from every incoming route;
- incompatible incoming payloads are a type error;
- `_` means the payload produced by the current widget or action route.

`run` wraps an async Rust function with `Task::perform`. `task` directly maps a
Rust function that already returns an iced `Task`, which exposes clipboard,
window, focus, scroll, font, system, cancellation, batching, and other runtime
operations without duplicating their implementation in Ice.

Multiple tasks can be composed as one structured final statement:

```ice
on refresh
  parallel
    run load_tasks() -> tasks_loaded _ | failed _
    run load_profile() -> profile_loaded _ | failed _

on save_then_refresh
  sequential
    run save_draft() -> saved _ | failed _
    run load_tasks() -> tasks_loaded _ | failed _
```

`parallel` lowers to `Task::batch`; `sequential` lowers to repeated
`Task::chain`. Groups may nest and accept only task-producing statements,
including native clipboard, system, font, widget, window, and pane-query tasks.
Sequential construction reads handler inputs and state before either task
runs; it orders runtime task actions, not the later processing of their routed
messages. Use a result handler when the next task needs state produced by the
previous result.

Native task cancellation stores iced's own handle in optional UI state:

```ice
state
  request:task-handle? = none

on start
  abortable request abort-on-drop
    run load_tasks() -> tasks_loaded _ | failed _

on cancel
  abort request

view
  col
    if aborted(request)
      text "Canceled"
```

`abortable` accepts exactly one task-producing child, including a nested task
group, and must be the final handler statement. It lowers to `Task::abortable`
and stores the returned handle. Optional `abort-on-drop` applies iced's
`Handle::abort_on_drop`; replacing the state handle or assigning `none` then
cancels unfinished work when the last clone drops. `abort handle` calls
`Handle::abort` when present and intentionally keeps the handle so
`aborted(handle)` can report its status. A missing handle reports `false`.
Task handles are opaque and cannot be compared or used as lazy keys.

Native task streams route every yielded item through `Task::run`:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  AppError(message:str)
  stream progress(total:i64) -> i64
  stream checked_progress() -> i64 ! AppError

on start
  parallel
    stream progress(100) -> progressed _
    stream checked_progress() -> progressed _ | failed _
```

An infallible stream item becomes the success-route payload. A fallible stream
must yield `Result<T, E>` items and requires both success and error routes.
Stream statements are task-producing, so they work inside `parallel`,
`sequential`, and `abortable` blocks. Because the mapping closure runs once per
item, stream routes may pass one `_` or discard the item with a parameterless
route; they cannot capture other expressions. Read current UI state inside the
destination handler.

Native sippers keep repeated progress distinct from their single final output
and lower through `Task::sip`:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  AppError(message:str)
  sip download(url:str) progress=f64 -> bytes ! AppError

on start
  sip download(url)
    progress -> downloading _
    done -> downloaded _
    error -> failed _
```

The Rust factory returns
`impl iced::task::Straw<Vec<u8>, f64, AppError> + Send + 'static` (or
`Sipper<Output, Progress>` when infallible). `progress` and `done` are required;
`error` is required only for a fallible declaration. Each route may pass one
`_` or discard its payload, and may not capture other expressions. A sip is a
task-producing statement and can be nested in `parallel`, `sequential`, and
`abortable`. Consumers must enable iced's `sipper` Cargo feature.

Typed task flows keep domain output unwrapped until the final UI route, so
native task combinators can depend on earlier output:

```ice
on start
  flow
    from stream page_ids(4)
    then id -> task load_page(id)
    collect
    done -> pages_loaded _
    units -> work_planned _
```

`from` accepts an extern `run`, `task`, or `stream` source and the built-in
system, clipboard-read, font-load, and image-allocation tasks. It also accepts `done expr` and
`none Type`, which lower directly to `Task::done` and `Task::none`:

```ice
flow
  from done 7
  then value -> done value + 1
  done -> finished _

flow
  from none i64
  done -> finished _
```

`then name -> source` lowers to `Task::then` and binds each output only inside
the next source call. Use
`try` for `T?` output or a fallible task; fallible steps must keep the same
error type required by iced's `Result` overload. A transform cannot capture UI
state because the native closure is static; pass stable input to the first
source or read current state in the destination handler.

`map name -> expr` lowers to `Task::map` and replaces each output with the
expression value. It may read only its binding. On a fallible flow it maps the
successful value and preserves the error type; on an optional flow the binding
is the whole optional value, matching native `Task::map` exactly:

```ice
flow
  from task load_count()
  map count -> count + 1
  done -> loaded _
  error -> failed _
```

`map-err error -> expr` lowers to `Task::map_err`, may read only its error
binding, and replaces the flow's error type with the expression type. A sync
extern is the normal way to translate one domain error into another:

```ice
flow
  from task request()
  map-err reason -> normalize_error(reason)
  collect
  done -> collected _
```

`collect` lowers to `Task::collect`. It changes an infallible `T` into `[T]`
and a fallible `T ! E` into `[result[T,E]]`, preserving each failure as data
and making the collected flow itself infallible.
`discard` must be last, suppresses both output routes, and lowers to
`Task::discard`. `units -> handler _` reads native `Task::units` during flow
construction and emits an `i64` notification alongside the task. Non-discarded
flows require `done`; fallible flows also require `error`. All three routes may
pass one `_` or discard their payload. Flows are task-producing and work inside
task groups and `abortable`.

Examples of payload flow:

```ice
checkbox task.title checked=task.done -> toggle(task.id, _)
run list_tasks() -> loaded _ | failed _
task copy_text(draft) -> copied

on toggle(id, checked)
  run set_task_done(id, checked) -> updated _ | failed _
```

`on mount` runs once during app initialization and has no parameters. Generated
message enums, update matching, owned clones, lifetimes, and `iced::Task::perform`
calls are backend details.

| `table` | maps typed rows into arbitrary structured headers/cells with complete sizing, padding, separator and alignment options |
| `editor` | binds owned multi-line content to generated iced actions with sizing, typography, wrapping, built-in highlighting and every concrete status style field |

`if` and `for` are child control-flow nodes inside a layout. There is no virtual
DOM or runtime reconciliation layer; the iced backend constructs the current
element tree from state.

Grid `cols=`, `min-cell=`, and `max-cell=` are mutually exclusive. `cols=` is
a positive `i64`; both cell widths and both dimensions of `h=aspect(W,H)` are
positive `f64` values. `min-cell=` uses as many columns as fit without making
a cell narrower than the requested width, matching CSS
`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(..., 1fr))` behavior with natural row height;
therefore it does not combine with `h=`. `max-cell=` exposes iced's native
fluid grid, which adds columns so cells do not exceed the requested width.
`w=` and `gap=` are non-negative `f64` pixels. A non-aspect
`h=` accepts `fill`, `fill(N)`, `shrink`, or a non-negative `f64` pixel
expression and maps to iced's evenly distributed sizing.

`box` is the explicit one-child wrapper used to size, align, clip, pad,
and style an arbitrary structured child tree. It accepts the shared surface
properties used by pane content and title bars: solid or linear background,
text, border with per-corner radius, shadow offset/blur, and pixel snapping.
Geometry uses typed properties; semantic color and emphasis utilities may be
layered on top when they do not duplicate a typed surface field:

```ice
box #card w=fill max-w=640.0 align-x=center p=12.0 bg=linear(1.57, surface@0.0, bg@1.0) r=10.0 shadow=black/50 shadow-y=2.0 shadow-blur=8.0 px-snap=true
  TaskRow task=task loading=loading
```

`style=summary_container(loading)` may call a declared `box-style`. Its
Rust function receives `&iced::Theme`, then its owned arguments, and returns
`container::Style`. Utilities and typed properties override that returned base.

An SVG accepts `style=status_svg(loading)` after a matching `svg-style`
declaration. The Rust function receives `&iced::Theme`, `svg::Status`, then its
owned arguments and returns `svg::Style`. Explicit `color=` and `hover=`
properties override the callback result for their respective statuses.

`col virtual-row=<estimate>` turns a column into a virtualized one: it accepts
every child but lays out only those the viewport can reach, sizing the rest
from the estimate until they scroll in and are measured for real. Text is
shaped during layout, so a child never laid out never shapes — which is where
the cost of a long list actually sits. Children keep their widget state, since
they stay in the tree; they are simply not measured, drawn, or offered events
while offscreen. Mount it inside a `scroll`. The estimate only needs the right
order of magnitude. `wrap` and `align=` are rejected on such a column (`E197`),
because both need every child measured.

Measuring a row that sits above the viewport moves everything below it, which
under a `scroll` anchored to the start shifts what the reader is looking at.
Put a virtualized column in a scroll with `anchor-y=end` whenever it is read
by scrolling back through unmeasured content — a message history, say. An
end-anchored scroll stores its offset as a distance from the bottom, so
content growing above the viewport carries the offset with it and the visible
rows stay put. Scrolling forward is unaffected either way, because rows enter
from the end and correct only what is already below.

Whichever child holds keyboard focus keeps being laid out wherever it drifts
to, so it still answers key presses and still moves focus correctly when the
reader tabs on. Accessibility is not covered the same way: publishing a child's
semantics requires laying it out, which is the cost being avoided, so a screen
reader sees only the visible slice and the column publishes no set metadata to
say how much it is not seeing. `.ice` tests read that same snapshot, so `click`
and `expect a11y` cannot reach an offscreen child. Use `virtual-row=` for long,
read-mostly content such as a message history; a collection that has to read
correctly to assistive tech needs a real list widget instead.

An `overlay` keeps the two trees explicit instead of relying on child order.
When its bool condition is true, `layer` floats over `content`; the backdrop
blocks button and scroll input and an optional `dismiss=` route handles a left
click outside the layer. Pointer events inside the layer do not dismiss it:

```ice
overlay when=about_open dismiss=close_about backdrop=black/60 p=24.0
  content
    Dashboard
  layer
    AboutDialog
```

Advanced overlays stay behind the existing typed component boundary instead
of duplicating the `Overlay` trait in Ice:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  component native_overlay(index:f64) -> unit

view
  extern native_overlay(42.0)
```

The Rust `Element` may contain a custom `Widget::overlay` implementation. Rust
therefore retains the complete native `Overlay` contract: layout, draw,
operate, update, mouse interaction, nested overlays, and `index()` ordering.
The generated component probe verifies the owned Element ABI; a non-unit
overlay event uses the same checked `-> handler _` mapping as any extern
component.

Rich text uses structured `span` children with `str`, `i64`, `f64`, or bool
expressions, so mixed formatting and links remain
readable without embedding markup in a string. A route is required exactly when
at least one span has a string `link=`:

```ice
rich-text w=fill wrap=word size=14.0 @text-muted -> open_link _
  span "Read the "
  span "Ice guide" link="https://example.com" underline @font-bold text-primary
  span "."
```

Rich defaults cover size, relative or absolute line height, font, bounds,
alignment, wrapping and color. A span can override size, line height, font and
color; attach a string link; use a solid or linear highlight background with
complete border/radius/padding; and toggle underline or strikethrough.

A pane grid owns persistent iced layout state generated from its required static
ID. Static names and checked `template(key)` references are the identities
exposed to Ice; native pane/split IDs stay inside generated Rust. `resize=` is
grab leeway and enables automatic ratio
updates, while `drag` automatically applies successful drop targets. A two-pane
layout uses the same explicit split tree as every larger layout:

```ice
panes #workspace w=fill h=fill gap=8.0 min-size=120.0 resize=6.0 drag click=pane_clicked(_)
  split vertical ratio=0.7
    pane files
      FileList
    pane editor
      Editor
```

For an arbitrary initial layout, nest binary split nodes. A root-level
`pane name closed` declares checked content without opening it:

```ice
panes #workspace w=fill h=fill
  split workspace_root vertical ratio=0.7
    pane files
      FileList
    split editor_stack horizontal ratio=0.6
      pane editor
        Editor
      pane terminal
        Terminal
  pane preview closed
    Preview
```

A runtime pane template repeats one checked pane body over list state. It is
initially closed; handlers open and target any item through the template's
bool, i64, f64, or str key:

```ice
state
  documents:[Document] = []
  selected_id = 42

on open_document
  pane #workspace split editor document(selected_id) horizontal ratio=0.4

on close_document(id)
  pane #workspace close document(id)

view
  panes #workspace
    pane editor
      EditorHome
    pane document in documents by=document.id maximized=is_maximized
      title
        text document.title
      controls
        button "Close" -> close_document document.id
      col
        if is_maximized
          text "Focused editor"
        DocumentEditor document=document
```

The list must be app state so the generated pane body can safely borrow its
current item. If an open key is no longer present, the pane renders a readable
missing-data placeholder until it is closed or the item returns. Opening the
same `template(key)` twice is a no-op. Optional `maximized=name` binds iced's
per-pane maximized callback flag as a checked bool inside that pane's title,
controls, content node, styles, and scoped IDs; it works on static, closed, and
runtime panes.

A pane may expose iced's native `Content`, `TitleBar`, and `Controls`
structure directly. `compact` is the fallback used when the full
controls would overlap the title. `always-controls` disables the default
hover-only visibility, and title padding accepts the same per-side precedence
as boxes:

```ice
panes #workspace resize=8.0 drag
  style
    hovered-region bg=linear(0.785, primary/10@0.0, primary/40@1.0) border=primary border-w=2.0 r=8.0
    hovered-split color=primary w=3.0
    picked-split color=fg w=3.0
  split vertical
    pane files bg=linear(1.57, surface@0.0, bg@1.0) border=border border-w=1.0 r=10.0 shadow=black/50 shadow-y=2.0 shadow-blur=8.0 px-snap=true
      title p=8.0 px=12.0 always-controls bg=bg border=border border-w=1.0 r-tl=8.0 r-tr=8.0
        text "Files" @font-bold
      controls
        row gap=8.0
          button "Refresh" -> refresh
          button "Close" -> close_files
      compact
        button "…" -> open_file_menu
      FileList
    pane editor
      Editor
```

Each pane requires exactly one direct content node; wrap siblings in `row` or
`col`. `controls` require `title`, and `compact` requires full `controls`.
Pane and title typed surface properties cover every
concrete `container::Style` field: solid or linear background, text, border
with per-corner radius, shadow offset/blur, and pixel snapping. Semantic
`@` colors may be used when they do not duplicate a typed field; layout stays
explicit in child nodes. Linear angles are radians, offsets are checked
in `0.0..=1.0`, and iced's maximum of eight color stops is enforced.

The optional first `style` child maps directly to iced's complete concrete
`pane_grid::Style`: hovered region solid or linear background and border
(including every corner radius), plus hovered and picked split line colors and
widths. Omitted fields retain `pane_grid::default(theme)`. Background parsing
is shared with pane surfaces instead of being a panes-only special case.
A declared `panes-style` call can provide the native runtime base instead;
the structured child still applies checked field overrides after that callback:

```ice
panes #workspace style=workspace_panes(loading)
  style
    picked-split w=4.0
  split vertical
    pane files
      FileList
    pane editor
      Editor
```

Pane grids may only live in the app view because component/repeated instances
need separately keyed persistent state. Click routes receive a stable `str`:
the static name or `template(key)` for a runtime pane.

Canvas is a checked declarative layer over iced's native `Canvas`, `Program`,
`Frame`, `Path`, and `Cache`. Its body is drawing code, not a widget subtree:

```ice
canvas w=fill h=220.0 cache=chart_version cache-group=charts capture=true cursor=(cursor_state) cursor-outside=true
  state
    cursor_state = "crosshair"
    drag_count = 0
    drag_x = 0.0
    drag_y = 0.0
  event mouse pressed as button
    set cursor_state = "grabbing"
    set drag_count = drag_count + 1
    emit chart_button button
    capture
  event mouse released as button
    set cursor_state = "crosshair"
    redraw
    capture
  event keyboard press -> chart_key _
  capture touch lost
  redraw window frame after=16ms
  rect x=0.0 y=0.0 w=canvas_width h=canvas_height fill=bg
  circle x=64.0 y=64.0 r=28.0 fill=primary stroke=fg stroke-w=2.0
  path fill=primary/25 stroke=primary stroke-w=2.0 cap=round join=round
    move x=96.0 y=160.0
    bezier ax=140.0 ay=20.0 bx=180.0 by=200.0 x=240.0 y=80.0
    line x=240.0 y=160.0
    close
  text "Drag me" x=16.0 y=196.0 color=fg size=14.0
  image logo x=264.0 y=16.0 w=48.0 h=48.0 filter=nearest opacity=0.9 snap=true r=6.0
  svg "icon.svg" x=320.0 y=16.0 w=48.0 h=48.0 color=primary rotate=0.1 opacity=0.9
```

`canvas_width` and `canvas_height` are scoped `f64` bindings containing the
current frame dimensions. A single optional `state` block declares typed,
per-canvas `Program::State`; its initializers are self-contained and cannot
capture app state or component parameters. Commands accept app state, canvas
state, and frame dimensions in expressions. Nested `if` and `for` commands draw
conditional or repeated geometry. `group` applies translation, rotation,
uniform/non-uniform scale and an optional `(x, y, width, height)` clip while
restoring the previous transform after its body.

`rect`, `circle`, and `path` accept a checked solid or `linear(...)` fill,
`non-zero` or `even-odd` fill rule, and an optional stroke. Strokes expose
width, butt/square/round caps, miter/round/bevel joins, dash segments and dash
offset. Path bodies map directly to move, line, arc, arc-to, ellipse, cubic
Bézier, quadratic, rectangle, per-corner rounded rectangle, circle, and close
builder calls. Canvas text accepts string/numeric content, position, maximum
width, color, size, relative/absolute line height, font, alignment and shaping.

`image source` draws either a path string or an `image` handle produced by
`encoded(...)`/`rgba(...)`. It requires `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`, and
exposes every concrete `iced::Image` field: linear/nearest filtering, rotation,
opacity, pixel snapping, and per-corner radius. `svg source` has the same bounds,
rotation, and opacity contract plus an optional checked color. Add the bare
`memory` flag to accept UTF-8 SVG text or raw bytes instead of a path. Both
commands draw inside the current frame transform and clip.

`cache=dependency` uses iced's geometry cache and clears it when the checked
hashable app dependency changes, the bounds change, or a canvas event updates
local state. Include every app state value that affects drawing in that
dependency; omit `cache=` for always-fresh geometry. `cache-group=name`
requires `cache=` and gives every canvas carrying
the same static name a shared native `canvas::Group`; this maps directly to
iced's grouped cache storage without changing invalidation keys. Pointer
press/release variants and move emit local `(x, y)` values;
scroll emits `(x, y, pixels)`. `enter`/`exit` have no payload. `capture=true`
marks emitted pointer events captured. Native consumers must enable iced's
`canvas` Cargo feature.

Canvas event directives expose the complete native `Program::update` event and
action surface without turning drawing commands into handlers:

```ice
event keyboard press -> chart_key _
event input-method preedit -> composing _ _ _
event mouse wheel -> wheel _ _ _
event touch moved -> touched _ _ _
event window resized -> resized _ _
capture window close-request
redraw window frame
redraw window frame after=16ms

event mouse moved as x, y
  set drag_x = x
  set drag_y = y
  redraw
  capture

event mouse released as button
  set cursor_state = "grab"
  emit released button
  capture
```

`event` accepts every input-method, keyboard, mouse, touch, and window variant
listed by `subscribe` and uses the same checked payload types. Mouse event
coordinates are raw window coordinates; the compact `move=` canvas property
continues to emit local coordinates. `capture source` returns iced's
capture-only action. `redraw source` requests the next frame, while `after=ms`
or `after=s` calls `request_redraw_at` relative to the current instant. A routed
event publishes a message and therefore already redraws. A structured event
uses `as` to name its typed payload, then may update local state with `set`,
choose one explicit `emit` or immediate/timed `redraw`, and optionally
`capture`. Publishing already requests a redraw. `emit` uses the named values
instead of `_`. Timed redraws use checked instant arithmetic and fall back to
an immediate redraw when a platform clock cannot represent the requested
deadline. `cursor=(expression)`
derives the complete iced mouse interaction from canvas state, while
`cursor-outside=true` lets that interaction remain active outside the bounds;
unknown runtime strings safely use the default interaction. `capture=true`
also marks routed and redraw actions captured. Event sources must be unique
within a canvas and these directives are allowed only at its root, not inside
drawing groups or control flow.

### View control flow

Literal `match` has first-match semantics. Each arm owns one or more nodes; an
optional `_` catch-all must be last:

```ice
match status
  "ready"
    text "Ready"
  "loading"
    text "Loading"
  _
    text "Unavailable"
```

Arm values are compared with checked equality. Exhaustiveness is not required;
without `_`, no arm renders when no value matches.

Option, result, and UI-enum patterns are exhaustive. `some(value)` and
`ok(value)`/`err(value)` introduce immutable payload names scoped to that arm;
`none` has no payload. An enum pattern uses `Enum.variant` or
`Enum.variant(value)` according to the declaration. Every variant must appear
exactly once unless a final `_` arm handles the remainder.

```ice
enum RequestState
  idle
  loading
  ready([Task])
  failed(AppError)

match request
  RequestState.idle
    text "Idle"
  RequestState.loading
    text "Loading…"
  RequestState.ready(tasks)
    TaskList tasks=tasks
  RequestState.failed(error)
    ErrorPanel message=error.message
```

UI enums are top-level, non-generic, and non-recursive. A variant has zero or
one payload, and payload types must be ordinary cloneable Ice data. Enums have
no methods or struct literals. Constructors use `Enum.variant` for an empty
variant and `Enum.variant(value)` for a payload variant. Fieldless enums support
`==` and `!=`. Payload-carrying enums do not support comparison and must be
inspected with exhaustive `match`.

### Components

Components are typed view templates. They remain pure by default, and may own
small UI-local state when the interaction belongs to the reusable view:

```ice
component Counter(label:str)
  state
    count = 0
  on increment
    count = count + 1
  col #root
    text label
    text count
    button "Increment" -> increment
```

They have one root, typed inputs, and no implicit capture of app state. A local
`state` block accepts self-contained ordinary cloneable values. Local `on`
handlers may assign that state, stop with `return if`, or end with a Future
extern call using `run`. They may also end with a widget operation targeting
their own rendered subtree. Other native tasks, streams, task composition,
lifecycle hooks, and implicit prop capture stay at app level. Pass a prop or
event value explicitly through the route when a local handler needs it.

A prop may declare a default after its type. Calls may omit that named prop;
required props must precede defaulted props:

```ice
component Panel(title:str, description:str="", elevated:bool=false)
  col
    text title
    text description

view
  Panel title="Settings"
```

Defaults are pure checked expressions evaluated without an environment. They
cannot refer to app state, component state, or any parameter (including an
earlier parameter), call an extern function, or belong to a `bind` prop.
Mutable component-only values such as `editor`,
`markdown`, `combo`, `animation`, task handles, and debug spans cannot have
defaults. A supplied argument always overrides the default.

`run latest` gives local request/response interactions latest-wins delivery:

```ice
component Search()
  state
    query = ""
    loading = false
    result:str? = none
  on search
    loading = true
    run latest fetch(query) -> loaded _ | failed _
  on loaded(value)
    result = some(value)
    loading = false
  on failed(error)
    loading = false
  col
    input "Query" <-> query
    button "Search" disabled=loading -> search
```

Each start advances an internal generation for that component scope and source
call site. A completion is routed only while its generation remains current;
the older Future itself keeps running. `run replace` instead wraps the Future
in Iced's native abortable task and aborts the previous handle for the same
component scope and source call site before storing the replacement. It is not
valid in an app-global handler because there is no component instance scope.
Ordinary `run` performs no filtering and delivers every completion. Future
values, request IDs, generations, and abort handles are not part of the
language surface.

Local state is keyed by the component's hierarchical instance scope, so two
explicit component IDs own independent values. The declared initializer is
used until the first local event materializes that instance. The default
`lifetime retained` keeps entries for the app lifetime, including while an
instance is absent from the current tree. Repeated dynamic retained instances
should therefore use stable IDs.

`lifetime mounted` marks the scopes present in each rendered root and removes
entries that disappear from that root. Removing an entry drops its local state,
latest-generation bookkeeping, and any `run replace` abort-on-drop handles.
Daemon roots include their window ID, so rendering one window never prunes
another window's scopes. There is no `on unmount` hook or other arbitrary
lifecycle effect; handlers remain the only place that starts work. Components
without local state or handlers remain compile-time view expansion rather than
runtime component objects.

A component may declare required or optional slots. Bare `slot` is the conventional
`children` slot and receives one structured child tree at its call site:

```ice
component Panel(title:str)
  col p=16.0 @bg-surface rounded-lg
    text title @font-bold
    slot

Panel title="Tasks" #tasks-panel
  scroll h=fill
    col
      for task in tasks
        TaskRow task=task loading=loading #task(task.id)
```

A component call uses checked named props in any order, as above. A bare
`name` item is shorthand for the passthrough `name=name`. Unknown,
missing, duplicate, and incorrectly typed props are compile-time errors.
Ordinary props are read-only. A component that writes through a prop declares
that capability with `bind`, and every caller uses `<->` explicitly:

```ice
component Field(bind value:str, label:str)
  col
    text label
    input "Value" <-> value

Field value<->draft label="Title"
```

A bind argument must be a direct app state, component-local state, or another
bind prop. `value=draft`, `value<->trim(draft)`, binding an ordinary prop inside
a component, and forwarding an ordinary prop are compile-time errors. This is
the only way component parameters carry writable state; ordinary `=` arguments
never forward a state binding.

For React-like compound structure, name the slots in the component and fill
them with readable `name:` blocks at the call site:

```ice
component Dialog()
  col p=24.0 @bg-surface rounded-lg
    slot header
    slot body
    slot actions

Dialog
  header:
    text "Delete task?" @font-bold
  body:
    text "This cannot be undone."
  actions:
    row gap=8.0
      button "Cancel" -> cancel
      button "Delete" -> delete
```

Qualified component names provide a React-style compound form without the
extra `name:` layer. A direct `Dialog.Name` child fills the matching `Name`
slot while remaining a normal checked component call:

```ice
component Dialog()
  col p=24.0 @bg-surface rounded-lg
    slot Header
    slot Body
    slot Actions

component Dialog.Header()
  row
    slot

component Dialog.Body()
  box w=fill
    slot

component Dialog.Actions()
  row gap=8.0
    slot

Dialog
  Dialog.Header
    text "Delete task?" @font-bold
  Dialog.Body
    text "This cannot be undone."
  Dialog.Actions
    row gap=8.0
      button "Cancel" -> cancel
      button "Delete" -> delete
```

All direct children in compound form must be immediate qualified children of
the parent call. Mixing a `Dialog.Header` child with an unrelated direct child
is a compile-time error. Explicit `header:` blocks remain useful when the slot
content should not have its own component styling or behavior.

Append `?` to a named slot to make it optional. A missing optional slot lowers
to no child at all. `provided(Name)` is a checked compile-time boolean inside
the component view, so wrappers can disappear with the slot:

```ice
if provided(Footer)
  box pt=12.0
    slot Footer?
```

Absence propagates through single-child wrappers until a multi-child layout
can omit that subtree. An entirely absent app or test root becomes an empty
column. Forwarding an optional slot preserves its `provided` status.

Every supplied slot accepts exactly one root. Wrap sibling nodes in `row`,
`col`, `grid`, or `stack`. Unknown, missing required, and duplicate slot names
are compile-time errors. A component can forward a named slot through another
component by placing `slot name` inside the corresponding `name:` block.

A component without slots rejects child content. Slot content keeps the
caller's state, loop bindings, handlers, and IDs while rendering under the
component instance scope.

Long widget and component metadata can move into a first-child `with` block.
It accepts only the same checked properties and `@` utilities as the parent;
actual children, slots, and status blocks remain siblings after it:

```ice
input "New task" #new-task <-> draft
  with
    hint="What needs doing?"
    disabled=loading
    w=fill
    @control

  active bg=surface border=border
  focused border=primary
```

Only one non-empty `with` block is allowed. The formatter owns its canonical
shape: at most two short metadata entries stay inline; longer metadata moves
to the first block, one property or utility per line, followed by `events`,
`forward`, slots/statuses, and content. Positional arguments and bindings stay
on the node's first line.

Components may expose one typed output. Route that output at every call site;
inside the component view, `emit` forwards the value:

```ice
component Toggle(checked:bool) -> bool
  extern native_toggle(checked) -> emit(_)

Toggle checked=checked -> changed _
```

A non-`unit` component requires a route, while a `unit` component rejects one.
`emit` accepts exactly one value matching the declared output and may be used
to forward nested component or extern-component output.

Components may instead expose multiple named events with zero or more ordered
typed payloads. Every declared event has exactly one route at each call site;
missing, unknown, and duplicate routes are errors. Event routes are checked in
the caller's scope, while emission is only valid inside the declaring
component view:

```ice
component PageItem(page:str)
  emits
    select(str)
    favorite(str, bool)
  col
    button "Open" -> emit(select, page)
    checkbox "Favorite" checked=false -> emit(favorite, page, _)

PageItem page="roadmap"
  events
    select -> navigate _
    favorite -> favorite_changed _ _
```

Exact same-name, same-signature forwarding has one explicit shorthand:

```ice
component PageMenu(page:str)
  emits
    select(str)
  PageItem page=page
    forward
      select
```

`forward select` is exactly `select -> emit(select, _)` without an intermediate
message. The outer event must exist with the identical payload signature;
wildcard forwarding and verbose identity routes are errors.

Ordered widget payloads may emit named component events directly. For example,
`sensor show=emit(measured, _, _)` and `resize=emit(measured, _, _)` pass the
measured `f64` width and height through the component contract.

A component route resolves only local component handlers and declared event
emissions. Direct references to app-global handlers are errors, so reusable
component dependencies remain explicit. A `lazy` subtree is no exception: only
its `cached` alias is in scope as a value, but the component's handlers,
events, and output remain routable there. The `component ... -> Type` and
call-site `-> route` pair remains the canonical default-event shorthand and may
coexist with named events.

### Extern components and subscriptions

An extern component is a typed Rust `Element` adapter with owned or borrowed
parameters:

```ice
extern native_help(external_hover) #help -> external_hover_changed _
extern borrowed_help(draft, external_hover) #borrowed-help -> external_hover_changed _
```

Its arguments and emitted payload are checked against the declaration. A
non-`unit` output requires a route. A `unit` component may omit the route; its
messages are mapped to an internal no-op. Extern components own their styling,
so `@` utilities are not accepted on the call. A direct `#id` identifies the
bounds of the returned native element for first-class tests.

Subscriptions are declared separately from activation:

```ice
subscribe
  every 500ms when auto_refresh -> tick
  input-method preedit -> composing _ _ _
  app_events() -> external_event _
  keyboard press -> key_pressed _
  keyboard release -> key_released _
  keyboard modifiers -> key_modifiers_changed _
  mouse moved -> pointer_moved _ _
  mouse wheel -> wheel_scrolled _ _ _
  touch pressed -> finger_pressed _ _ _
```

The compiler batches active subscriptions and wires the application builder.
Subscription routes accept only `_`; handlers can read current state after the
event arrives. This prevents generated `'static` subscription closures from
capturing a borrowed application state.

Any source may have a boolean activation condition between the source and
route:

```ice
subscribe
  every 2s when auto_refresh && online -> refresh
  keyboard press when shortcuts_enabled -> key_pressed _
```

The condition is type-checked and evaluated from current app state whenever
iced rebuilds subscriptions. False returns `Subscription::none()`, so an
inactive timer or external stream is actually stopped instead of merely
dropping its messages.

Runtime event sources may also filter iced's dispatch status:

```ice
subscribe
  event status=any -> runtime_event _
  event with-id status=ignored -> window_event _ _
  mouse moved status=captured -> drag_moved _ _
  keyboard press status=ignored when shortcuts_enabled -> key_pressed _
  window close-request status=any -> close_requested
```

`captured` means a widget handled the event; `ignored` means none did; `any`
accepts both and is the default when `status=` is omitted. The modifier is
available on generic, input-method, keyboard, mouse, touch, and non-frame
window events. Timers, system/extern subscriptions, and raw window frames have
no iced event status and reject it.

`event` carries the complete native `iced::Event` value across handlers and
typed extern functions. Non-raw events lower to `event::listen_with` so the
status rule is uniform. `event raw` lowers to `event::listen_raw`, includes
redraw requests, and therefore must be filtered or routed without causing
another redraw; an unfiltered raw listener can loop forever. `with-id` prepends
the originating `window-id`. Runtime system-theme
changes are not `iced::Event` values and remain available through
`system theme`.

Generic events support the same transforms as every native source:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  sync label_event(value:event) -> str?

subscribe
  event filter=label_event status=any -> labeled _
  event raw with-id status=captured -> captured _ _
```

Every native or extern source also supports iced's identity and output
transforms:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  sync visible_pointer(x:f64, y:f64) -> str?

state
  generation = 7

on pointer_moved(generation, position)

subscribe
  mouse moved with=generation filter=visible_pointer -> pointer_moved _ _
```

`filter=` names a declared `sync` function and lowers to
`Subscription::filter_map`. Its parameters exactly match the source payloads:
no parameters for a payload-free event, one for a scalar source, and one per
field for a multi-payload native event. It must return `T?`; after filtering,
the route has one `T` payload. The generated closure captures nothing.

`with=` lowers to `Subscription::with`, participates in the subscription's
iced identity, and becomes the first route payload. It accepts Ice values with
a statically hashable type; extern value types must additionally implement
Rust's `Hash + Clone + Send + Sync + 'static` contract. Filtering happens
before context is attached. Both modifiers are optional and routes may omit
all `_` placeholders when their values are intentionally discarded.

Declared `stream` externs can also become long-lived subscriptions:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  stream worker() -> str
  stream room_events(room:i64, generation:i64) -> str

subscribe
  run worker() -> received _
  run room_events(room, generation) -> received _
```

A zero-argument `run` passes the Rust function item to
`Subscription::run`. One or more arguments lower to `Subscription::run_with`;
their value, or ordered tuple of values, is the subscription identity data and
the generated noncapturing builder clones it into the declared stream
function. Every data argument must be hashable. A fallible declaration
`stream ... -> T ! E` emits one `result[T,E]` payload so failures remain stream
values. These sources may use the same `with=`, `filter=`, and `when` modifiers
as every other subscription.

Custom iced recipes use the same checked source shape:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  recipe counter(id:i64) -> i64

subscribe
  recipe counter(generation) -> counted _
```

The factory arguments are checked against Rust, its concrete return type must
implement `iced::advanced::subscription::Recipe<Output = T>`, and the source
lowers directly to `advanced::subscription::from_recipe`. Ice owns only the
route and optional transforms; Rust retains the recipe's identity hashing,
runtime-event input, stream, and cancellation behavior.

Raw runtime events can be narrowed by a typed Rust filter without exposing
iced's large platform event enum in Ice:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  event-filter runtime_event() -> str

state
  event_identity = 1

subscribe
  events event_identity using=runtime_event -> received _
```

The identity expression must be hashable. The declared function takes no Ice
parameters because Rust receives one implicit
`iced::advanced::subscription::Event` and returns `Option<T>`. Generated code
uses a native `Recipe` over iced's `EventStream`, hashes both the filter type
and identity, and forwards only `Some(T)`. This exposes interaction window IDs,
dispatch status, all runtime event variants, and system-theme changes while
preserving native cancellation.

Together, the declarative sources and typed adapters cover the complete
application-facing `iced::Subscription` construction surface: `none`, `batch`,
`run`, `run_with`, `from_recipe`, `with`, `map`, `filter_map`, and `units`.
`iced::advanced::subscription::into_recipes` is the runtime consumer that
extracts boxed recipes after an application has built a subscription; it does
not create or transform an application subscription, so it intentionally has
no source-language form.

Ice covers all three public iced time operations with its native monotonic
`instant` type:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  refresh_status() -> i64

state
  last:instant? = none

on read_time
  task time now -> tick _

on tick(now)
  last = some(now)

subscribe
  every 500ms -> tick _
  repeat refresh_status() every 2s -> refreshed _
```

`task time now` lowers to `iced::time::now`. `every` forwards each native
`Instant`; the route may omit `_` when it does not need the tick value.
`repeat` accepts a declared zero-argument async extern and lowers its function
item directly to `iced::time::repeat`. A fallible extern produces
`result[T,E]` values instead of splitting the subscription into success/error
routes. Durations must be positive whole numbers using `ms` or `s`. `every`
requires iced's `tokio` or `smol` Cargo feature; `repeat` requires `tokio`,
which the reference app uses.

Native keyboard subscriptions infer structured payloads. Press events expose
`key:key`, `modified_key:key`, `physical_key:physical-key`,
`location:key-location`, `modifiers:key-modifiers`, optional `text`, and
`repeat`; release events expose the same fields except `text` and `repeat`.
These four public types are the exact native iced values, so state and typed
extern functions can preserve them without string conversion.

```ice
state
  shortcut:key = key.named("Enter")
  scan:physical-key = key.code("Enter")
  location:key-location = key.location("standard")
  modifiers:key-modifiers = key.modifiers(false, true, false, false)
  latin:str? = none

on pressed(event)
  latin = key.latin(event.key, event.physical_key)
  shortcut = event.key
```

`key.named("Variant")` and `key.code("Variant")` accept exact iced Rust enum
variant names and lower directly, covering every current named and physical
code without a second alias catalog; rustc reports an unknown variant during
`cargo ice check`. `key.character(str)` and `key.unidentified()` construct the
other logical variants. `key.native_unidentified()` and literal
`key.native("android" | "macos" | "windows" | "xkb", code)` construct every
native physical variant with checked integer ranges. For runtime integers,
`key.try_native(platform, code) -> physical-key?` returns none on overflow.

`key.location("standard" | "left" | "right" | "numpad")` covers every
location. `key.modifiers(shift, control, alt, logo)` constructs any flag set;
`key.command_modifiers()` preserves iced's platform-dependent `COMMAND`
constant. Modifier values expose `shift`, `control`, `alt`, `logo`, `command`,
`jump`, and `macos_command` booleans. Logical keys expose `kind`, optional
`named`, and optional `character`; physical keys expose `kind`, optional
`code`, `native_platform`, and `native_code`; locations expose `name`.
Equality compares the native typed values, and `key.latin` delegates to iced's
native locale-aware physical-key translation. Like `iced::keyboard::listen`,
these subscriptions receive keyboard events that no widget captured.

Pointer values also preserve iced's native types across state, handlers, and
typed extern functions:

```ice
state
  position:point = point(12.0, 24.0)
  offset:vector = vector(10.0, 20.0)
  extent:size = size(100.0, 80.0)
  bounds:rectangle = rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 80.0)
  transform:transformation = transform.compose(transform.translate(10.0, 20.0), transform.scale(2.0))
  button:mouse-button = mouse.button("left")
  cursor:mouse-cursor = mouse.cursor(point(12.0, 24.0))
  click:mouse-click = mouse.click(point(12.0, 24.0), mouse.button("left"), none)
  finger:touch-finger = touch.finger("18446744073709551615")
```

`mouse.button` accepts `left`, `right`, `middle`, `back`, and `forward`.
`mouse.other_button` accepts a checked literal `u16` value;
`mouse.try_other_button(i64) -> mouse-button?` safely handles runtime values.
`touch.finger` accepts a checked decimal `u64` string, preserving the full
native identifier without unsigned Ice arithmetic, while
`touch.try_finger(str) -> touch-finger?` parses runtime input safely.

`mouse.cursor(point)`, `mouse.levitating(point)`, and `mouse.unavailable()`
construct all cursor variants. `mouse.cursor_position`, `cursor_over`,
`cursor_in`, and `cursor_from` expose iced's optional coordinate queries;
`cursor_is_over`, `cursor_is_levitating`, `cursor_levitate`, `cursor_land`, and
`cursor_translate` expose its variant and vector-translation behavior.
`mouse.click` creates a native click from a point, button, and optional previous
click. Point, vector, size, and rectangle coordinates are `f64` in Ice and
lower to iced's `f32` geometry.

`interaction.default/none/hidden/idle/context_menu/help/pointer/progress/wait/
cell/crosshair/text/alias/copy/move/no_drop/not_allowed/grab/grabbing/
resize_horizontal/resize_vertical/resize_diagonal_up/resize_diagonal_down/
resize_column/resize_row/all_scroll/zoom_in/zoom_out()` construct the default
and every `iced::mouse::Interaction` variant. A value exposes its kebab-case
`.kind`, supports native equality and ordering, and crosses typed extern
boundaries exactly. The native enum does not implement `Hash`, so it is
deliberately rejected as a lazy dependency.

Mouse areas and canvases accept first-class values with
`cursor=(interaction_expression)`. Their existing compact cursor names remain
equivalent human-readable sugar; canvases also retain runtime string cursor
selection for mutable local state.

`scroll.lines(x, y)` and `scroll.pixels(x, y)` construct both native
`iced::mouse::ScrollDelta` variants. Each value exposes `.kind`, `.x`, and `.y`,
supports equality and exact typed extern passage, and preserves negative and
fractional native coordinates. It is rejected for ordering and lazy identity
because the native floating-point enum implements neither `Ord` nor `Hash`.
Existing mouse-area, canvas, and subscription scroll routes keep their readable
`x, y, pixels` payloads as destructuring sugar for the same native variants.

`event_status.ignored/captured()` construct both native
`iced::event::Status` variants. `event_status.merge(left, right)` preserves the
native rule that `Captured` takes precedence, and `.kind` exposes `ignored` or
`captured`. Values support native equality and exact typed extern passage.
Ordering and lazy identity are rejected because the native enum implements
neither `Ord` nor `Hash`. Existing subscription status filters remain readable
keyword sugar for the same two statuses.

`window_direction.north/south/east/west/north_east/north_west/south_east/
south_west()` construct every native resize direction.
`window_level.default/normal/always_on_bottom/always_on_top()`,
`window_mode.windowed/fullscreen/hidden()`, and
`window_attention.critical/informational()` cover every variant of their native
enums. Each value exposes a kebab-case `.kind` and crosses typed extern
boundaries exactly.

Level and mode values support native equality; ordering is rejected. Direction
and user-attention values reject all comparisons because their native enums do
not implement `PartialEq`. None is a lazy identity because the native types do
not implement `Hash`. Existing window task keywords remain concise equivalent
sugar.

`window_position.default/centered/specific(point)` construct the native
default, centered, and fixed-coordinate variants. A `window-position` exposes
`.kind` and an optional `.point`; callback positions use `specific-with` and
have no fixed point. The native enum does not implement `PartialEq` or `Hash`,
so all comparisons and lazy identity are rejected.

`Position::SpecificWith(fn(Size, Size) -> Point)` crosses the existing typed
`sync` boundary exactly: a Rust sync extern returns `window-position`, and
rustc checks the callback signature while Ice stores and passes the native
function pointer unchanged. Existing initial-window `default`, `centered`, and
`specific(x, y)` settings remain concise equivalent sugar.

`redraw_request.next_frame/at(instant)/wait()` construct all three native
`iced::window::RedrawRequest` variants. Values expose `.kind` and an optional
`.instant`, preserve native equality and ordering, and cross typed extern
boundaries exactly. They are rejected as lazy dependencies because the native
enum does not implement `Hash`. Existing canvas/shader redraw commands and raw
event routing remain concise behavior-level sugar.

`window_id.unique()` calls native `iced::window::Id::unique`, while `.display`
uses the native decimal `Display` implementation. IDs preserve native equality,
ordering, hashable lazy identity, and exact typed extern passage. Window task,
daemon, and subscription payloads use the same first-class type.

`screenshot.new(bytes, size-u32, scale)` calls native `Screenshot::new`.
Screenshots expose `.rgba:bytes`, `.size:size-u32`, `.scale_factor:f64`, and
`.debug:str`. `screenshot.as_bytes` and `screenshot.into_bytes` preserve the
borrowed and owned byte views at Ice's owned `bytes` boundary.

`screenshot.crop(value, rectangle-u32)` returns the cropped screenshot or
`none`. `screenshot.crop_error` returns `zero`, `out-of-bounds`, or `none`, and
`screenshot.crop_error_message` preserves the native Display message. The
crop boundary validates region arithmetic and RGBA length before calling Iced,
so malformed constructed or extern values return `out-of-bounds` instead of panicking. The
native value is cloneable but implements neither equality nor hashing, so
comparisons and lazy identity are rejected. Typed sync externs pass the exact
`iced::window::Screenshot` value.

Fields are checked: points and vectors expose `x/y` plus lossless two-value
`values`; points also expose native `display`; sizes expose `width/height` plus
`values`; rectangles expose `x/y/width/height`, `center`, `center_x`,
`center_y`, `position`, `size`, and `area`; buttons expose `kind`
and optional `number`; cursors expose `kind`, optional `position`, and
`levitating`; clicks expose `kind` and `position`; fingers expose their
lossless decimal `id`.

Native units remain first-class iced values instead of becoming untyped
numbers:

```ice
state
  gap:pixels = pixels(8.0)
  inset:padding = padding(4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0)
  quarter:degrees = degrees(45.0) * 2.0
  rotation:radians = radians.from_degrees(quarter)

on inspect
  inset = padding.fit(inset, size(80.0, 40.0), size(96.0, 56.0))
  rotation = (rotation + radians.pi()) % radians(6.0)
```

`pixels(value)` and `pixels.zero()` construct native `Pixels`;
`pixels.from_u32(literal)` checks the full native range and
`pixels.try_from_u32(i64) -> pixels?` safely converts runtime integers. Pixels
expose their `value`, native equality/order, and every native `+`, `*`, and `/`
combination with another pixels value or an Ice `f64`. The native `u32`
division form is represented by the same checked f64 scalar operation.

`padding(top, right, bottom, left)`, `padding.zero`, `all`, `top`, `right`,
`bottom`, `left`, `horizontal`, `vertical`, and `axes(vertical, horizontal)`
cover every native constructor and scalar/axis conversion.
`padding.from_pixels` preserves the exact Pixels conversion. `with_top`,
`with_right`, `with_bottom`, `with_left`, `with_horizontal`, and
`with_vertical` call the native builder methods and accept either f64 or
pixels. Padding exposes each side plus computed `x/y`; `padding.fit` delegates
to iced's size-constrained fit. `size.from_padding`,
`rectangle.expand_padding`, and `rectangle.shrink_padding` preserve the native
conversion and geometry behavior. Padding values support equality and typed
extern passage.

`degrees(value)` and `radians(value)` narrow numeric construction to native
f32. Both expose their lossless Ice-f64 `value`, equality/order against their
own type, and iced's angle-left comparison against f64. Degrees support native
f64 multiplication. Radians support same-type `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, f64
scaling in either native direction, and native addition of Degrees.
`radians.from_degrees` performs iced's exact conversion; `radians.pi` exposes
the native constant and `display` uses native formatting.

`degrees.range_start/end/in_range` and `radians.range_start/end/in_range`
expose the full native `RangeInclusive` behavior without adding a speculative
generic range type. `radians.distance_start/end` expose both points returned by
native `to_distance`. Size and rectangle rotation accept either f64 radians or
a first-class radians value; `rectangle.vertices_angle` keeps the exact native
radians result alongside the f64 `vertices_rotation` projection.

`rotation.default()` and `rotation.from(f64)` preserve iced's floating default
and scalar conversion. `rotation.floating(radians)` and
`rotation.solid(radians)` construct both native variants;
`rotation.with_radians(value, radians)` updates the angle through the native
`radians_mut` method and returns the value. A rotation exposes checked
`.radians`, `.degrees`, and `.kind` (`floating` or `solid`) projections, supports
native equality and typed extern passage, and `rotation.apply(value, size)`
returns iced's exact minimum layout size. Image and SVG `rotate=` properties
accept only this first-class value.

`fit.default()` and `fit.contain()` produce iced's default `Contain` strategy;
`fit.cover`, `fit.fill`, `fit.none`, and `fit.scale_down` construct every other
native variant. A content-fit value exposes `.kind` with the compact kebab name
and `.display` through iced's native formatter, supports equality, lazy hashing,
and typed extern passage, and `fit.apply(value, content_size, bounds_size)` calls
the exact native sizing algorithm. Image, SVG, and Viewer `fit=` properties
accept the first-class value directly; their existing compact names remain
equivalent sugar.

`color.default()`, `color.black()`, `color.white()`, and `color.transparent()`
produce the native default and constants. `color.rgb`, `color.rgba`,
`color.rgb8`, `color.rgba8`, and `color.linear_rgba` call the corresponding
native constructors; the three 8-bit channels are checked integer literals in
`0..=255`. `color.try_rgb8(i64, i64, i64)` and
`color.try_rgba8(i64, i64, i64, f64)` accept dynamic channels and return `none`
instead of wrapping an out-of-range value. `color.from3` and `color.from4`
preserve iced's array conversions. Floating-point color constructor channels
are checked statically when literal and clamped to `0.0..=1.0` when dynamic;
`color.try_rgba8` returns `none` for a dynamic alpha outside that range.
`color.parse(str) -> color?` accepts every native 3/4/6/8-digit RGB hexadecimal
form and maps its native parse error to `none`.

A color exposes `.r`, `.g`, `.b`, `.a`, `.rgba8`, `.linear`, `.luminance`, and
`.display`. `color.inverse` and `color.invert` return the same channel-wise
inverse, avoiding iced 0.14's broken in-place channel update; `color.scale_alpha`
returns the native alpha-scaled color;
`color.luminance`, `color.contrast`, and `color.readable(foreground, background)`
call iced's exact WCAG calculations. Colors support equality and typed extern
passage. They are deliberately rejected as lazy identities because native
`Color` contains floating-point channels and does not implement `Hash`.

`color_stop.default()` and `color_stop(offset, color)` construct exact native
gradient stops. A stop exposes `.offset` and `.color`, supports equality and
typed extern passage, and is not a lazy identity because it contains floating
point values.

`linear(angle)` constructs `iced::gradient::Linear` and accepts either `f64` or
`radians`. `linear.add_stop` and `linear.add_stops` delegate to the native
sorting, finite/range rejection, and eight-stop limit; `linear.scale_alpha`
preserves the native stop-color operation. Existing malformed stops received
from extern Rust are discarded before adding, instead of reaching the native
sorter's partial-order panic. A linear gradient exposes `.angle`
and its exact eight-entry `[color-stop?]` `.stops`, supports equality and typed
extern passage, and is not a lazy identity.

`gradient.linear` constructs the native enum variant while
`gradient.from_linear` preserves its native conversion. A gradient exposes
`.kind` and `.linear`; `gradient.scale_alpha` delegates to the native operation.
`background.color` and `background.gradient` construct both native variants;
`background.from_color`, `background.from_gradient`, and
`background.from_linear` preserve every native conversion. A background
exposes `.kind`, optional `.color`, and optional `.gradient`, and
`background.scale_alpha` handles either variant. Both types support equality
and typed extern passage but remain unavailable as floating-point lazy
identities. Existing solid/linear style properties remain compact equivalent
sugar.

`font.default()`, `font.sans()`, and `font.monospace()` produce the native
default, `Font::DEFAULT`, and `Font::MONOSPACE` values. `font.with_name("Inter")`
maps to `Font::with_name`, while `font.new(family, weight, stretch, style)`
constructs the complete public value. Names must be string literals because
iced stores them as `&'static str`.

`family.default/serif/sans_serif/cursive/fantasy/monospace()` cover the default
and every non-named family variant; `family.named("Inter")` covers `Name` with
the same static-literal rule. A family exposes `.kind` and optional owned
`.name`. `weight.default/thin/extra_light/light/normal/medium/semibold/bold/
extra_bold/black()` and `stretch.default/ultra_condensed/extra_condensed/
condensed/semi_condensed/normal/semi_expanded/expanded/extra_expanded/
ultra_expanded()` cover every native descriptor. `font_style.default/normal/
italic/oblique()` covers every style. Each descriptor exposes a compact
kebab-case `.kind`.

A font exposes `.family`, `.weight`, `.stretch`, and `.style`. All five values
support equality, hashable lazy identity, and exact typed extern passage;
ordering is rejected. Existing `font name family=... weight=... stretch=...
style=...` declarations and `font=default`/`font=mono` properties remain the
human-readable widget sugar over the same native descriptors.

`theme_mode.default/none/light/dark()` cover the default and every native
`iced::theme::Mode` variant. Values expose `.kind`, support equality and exact
typed extern passage, and reject ordering and lazy identity because the native
enum implements neither `Ord` nor `Hash`. App theme names and native Theme
factories remain the human-readable behavior-level layer.

`text_alignment.default/left/center/right/justified()` cover every native text
alignment variant. `text_alignment.from_horizontal`,
`text_alignment.from_alignment`, and `horizontal.from_text_alignment` preserve
all native conversions. `text_shaping.default/auto/basic/advanced()` covers
every shaping strategy while leaving the default feature-aware, and
`text_wrapping.default/none/word/glyph/word_or_glyph()` covers every wrapping
strategy.

`line_height.default/relative/absolute()` constructs both native line-height
variants. `line_height.from_f64`, `line_height.from_pixels`, and
`line_height.to_absolute` preserve both native conversions and absolute pixel
resolution. Enum values expose `.kind`; line heights additionally expose
optional `.relative` and `.absolute` payloads. All four values support equality,
hashable lazy identity, and exact typed extern passage; ordering is rejected.
Existing `align-x=`, `shape=`, `wrap=`, `line-h=`, and
`line-h-px=` properties remain the concise widget sugar.

`length.fill()`, `length.fill_portion(u16 literal)`, `length.shrink()`, and
`length.fixed(f64)` construct every native variant. Dynamic `i64` portions use
`length.try_fill_portion(value) -> length?`, which returns `none` outside the
native `u16` range. `length.from_f64`, `length.from_pixels`, and
`length.from_u32` call all three native conversions; dynamic unsigned units use
`length.try_from_u32(value) -> length?` without wrapping.

A length exposes `.fill_factor`, `.is_fill`, `.kind`, optional `.portion`, and
optional `.fixed` projections. `length.fluid(value)` and
`length.enclose(value, other)` call the exact native layout methods. Lengths
support equality and typed extern passage, and may be used directly in every
view property whose iced builder accepts `Length`; the compact `fill`,
`fill(N)`, `shrink`, and numeric spellings remain equivalent sugar. Native
floating fixed lengths do not implement `Hash`, so lengths are rejected as lazy
identities.

`alignment.start/center/end`, `horizontal.left/center/right`, and
`vertical.top/center/bottom` construct every variant of iced's three alignment
enums. `alignment.from_horizontal`, `alignment.from_vertical`,
`horizontal.from_alignment`, and `vertical.from_alignment` preserve all native
conversions. Each value exposes a compact `.kind`, supports equality, hashable
lazy identity, and typed extern passage. Existing view properties keep their
short `start/center/end`, `left/center/right`, and `top/center/bottom` sugar.

`border.default()` and `border.new(color, width, radius)` construct complete
native values. `border.color`, `border.width`, and `border.rounded` map the
three native free constructors; `border.with_color`, `border.with_width`, and
`border.with_radius` map the three consuming builders. Width accepts `f64` or
`pixels`; radius accepts `f64` or `radius`. A border exposes `.color`, `.width`,
and `.radius`, supports equality and typed extern passage, and is not a lazy
identity because it contains floating-point values.

`radius(value)`, `radius.new(value)`, and `radius.default()` map the native free
uniform constructor, associated constructor, and default respectively.
`radius.top_left/top_right/bottom_right/bottom_left/top/bottom/left/right`
construct each native partial shape; the matching `radius.with_*` forms take an
existing radius first and call every consuming builder. Pixel inputs accept
`f64` or `pixels`. `radius.from_f64/from_u8/from_u32/from_i32` preserve all four
native conversions, with checked literal integer ranges; `radius.try_from_u8`,
`radius.try_from_u32`, and `radius.try_from_i32` safely handle dynamic `i64`
inputs. A radius exposes all four corner fields and `.values` in native corner
order, supports equality, `radius * f64`, and typed extern passage, and is not a
lazy identity because its corners are floating-point values.

`shadow.default()` constructs the native default. `shadow.new(color, offset,
blur)` constructs an exact `iced::Shadow`; the checked arguments are `color`,
`vector`, and `f64`, with narrowing to native `f32` only at code generation.
A shadow exposes `.color`, `.offset`, and `.blur`, supports equality and typed
extern passage, and is deliberately rejected as a lazy identity because its
native color and blur fields contain floating-point values.

The default iced `f32` geometry API has direct checked expressions:

```ice
state
  origin:point = point.origin()
  snapped:point-u32 = point.snap(point(3.25, 4.75))
  unit:size = size.unit()
  bounds:rectangle = rectangle.with_size(size(640.0, 480.0))

on inspect
  distance = point.distance(origin, point(3.0, 4.0))
  moved = (bounds + vector(4.0, 8.0)) * 2.0
  overlap = rectangle.intersection(bounds, moved)
```

Points support `+/- vector` and point subtraction produces a vector. Vectors
support negation, vector `+/-`, and `*` or `/ f64`. Sizes support size `+/-`,
`*` or `/ f64`, and component multiplication by a vector. Rectangles support
`+/- vector` and `* f64`. Codegen narrows Ice scalars to the native `f32`
operand only at these typed operations.

`point.origin`, `point.distance`, and `point.snap` cover point constants and
queries; `vector.zero` is the native zero value. Sizes provide `zero`, `unit`,
`infinite`, `min`, `max`, `expand`, `rotate`, `ratio`, `from_vector`, and
`vector.from_size`. `size.from_u32` accepts two checked literal `u32` values;
`size.try_from_u32(i64, i64) -> size?` returns none for runtime overflow.

Rectangles provide `zero`, `infinite`, `with_size`, `with_radius`,
`with_vertices`, `vertices_rotation`, `contains`, `distance`, `offset`,
`is_within`, `intersection`, `intersects`, `union`, `snap`, `expand`, `shrink`,
`rotate`, `zoom`, `anchor`, and `from_u32`. Expand and shrink take exact
`top, right, bottom, left` values. Rotate and vertex rotation use radians.
Anchor accepts checked `left|center|right` and `top|center|bottom` literals.

Snapping preserves iced's exact unsigned results: `point.snap` returns
`point-u32`, while `rectangle.snap` returns `rectangle-u32?`. Their coordinates
and dimensions project to lossless Ice `i64` values and both types can cross a
typed extern boundary. `rectangle.from_u32` converts an exact snapped rectangle
back to the default native `f32` rectangle.

`transform.identity()`, `transform.translate(x, y)`, and
`transform.scale(factor)` construct native transformations.
`transform.orthographic(width, height)` accepts two literal values in the full
native `u32` range; `transform.try_orthographic(i64, i64) -> transformation?`
safely handles runtime dimensions. `transform.inverse(value)` and
`transform.compose(left, right)` preserve iced's exact matrix behavior and
composition order. Transformations expose `scale_factor`, `translation`, and a
lossless 16-value `matrix` projection.

`transform.point`, `transform.vector`, `transform.size`,
`transform.rectangle`, `transform.cursor`, and `transform.click` apply the
native matrix to every iced value that implements transformation
multiplication. All geometry and transformation values can cross typed extern
boundaries unchanged. `mouse-click` uses iced's advanced mouse API and
therefore requires the `advanced` Cargo feature. Native clicks do not implement
equality; compare their checked `kind` or `position` fields instead.

Input-method composition events use a separate readable source:

```ice
subscribe
  input-method opened -> composition_opened
  input-method preedit -> composition_changed _ _ _
  input-method commit -> composition_committed _
  input-method closed -> composition_closed
```

Preedit emits `(text:str, start:i64?, end:i64?)`; both byte offsets are absent
when iced hides the composition cursor. Commit emits the final `str`, while
opened and closed have no payload. These subscriptions observe captured and
ignored events and require iced's `advanced` Cargo feature.

System queries and theme changes use the same task/subscription model:

```ice
on inspect
  task system info -> inspected _

on read_theme
  task system theme -> theme_changed _

subscribe
  system theme -> theme_changed _
```

`system theme` produces `"none"`, `"light"`, or `"dark"`. The inferred
`system-info` payload exposes `system_name`, `system_kernel`, `system_version`,
`system_short_version`, `cpu_brand`, `cpu_cores`, `memory_total`, `memory_used`,
`graphics_backend`, and `graphics_adapter`. Optional iced fields remain
optional; core and byte counts use `i64` and saturate at `i64::MAX` instead of
wrapping. `task system info` requires iced's `sysinfo` Cargo feature. Both
system tasks are infallible and reject an error route.

Clipboard effects cover both platform targets:

```ice
task clipboard read -> clipboard_read _
task clipboard read-primary -> primary_read _
task clipboard write draft
task clipboard write-primary draft
```

Reads are infallible tasks with a `str?` payload because the target may not
contain text. Writes require `str`, produce no message in iced, accept no route,
and must be the handler's final statement.

Font declarations map directly to iced's complete `Font` descriptor:

```ice
font brand family="Inter" weight=semibold stretch=normal style=italic default=true

view
  text "Brand" font=brand
```

The family may be a named family or any of iced's five generic families. Every
weight, stretch, and style variant is accepted. At most one declaration may be
the application default. `font=default` and `font=mono` remain built-ins;
`default` and `mono` therefore cannot be declaration names. Declared fonts also
work on text, rich text and spans, input, editor, checkbox, toggler, radio, pick,
combo, and their custom icons. App-level `font "path"`
settings embed and preload the corresponding bytes before iced starts; a
descriptor's named family selects the family exposed by those bytes.
The generated Rust app exposes the effective descriptor through
`App::default_font()`. It returns the declaration marked `default=true`, or
`iced::Font::DEFAULT` when none is declared, so native adapters can share the
same application font without duplicating its family.

Runtime bytes use iced's native font Task directly:

```ice
on load_font
  task font load downloaded_font_bytes -> font_loaded _
```

The expression must be `bytes`, the success payload is `unit`, and the task is
treated as infallible because iced's current `font::Error` has no variants.

Image preallocation is a fallible native task:

```ice
task image allocate handle -> allocated _ | allocation_failed _
```

Success carries `image-allocation`; failure carries the exact `image-error`.
Both routes are required, and the task composes inside task groups, abortable
tasks, and typed task flows.

Widget operation tasks target checked IDs in the app view:

```ice
task widget focus #search
task widget focused #search -> focus_checked _
task widget cursor #search 3
task widget select #search 0 5
task widget snap #results 0.0 1.0
task widget scroll-by #results 0.0 24.0
```

Targets use the same hierarchy as the rendered component tree. Write the
outer scope first, then each nested scope separated by `/`:

```ice
state
  selected = 42
  draft = ""

component Dialog()
  col
    slot

component TaskField(value:str)
  input "Title" #title <-> value

on edit_selected
  task widget focus #dialog(selected)/TaskField/title

view
  Dialog #dialog(selected)
    TaskField value=draft
```

Only explicit component IDs create a public target scope. A component call
without one receives an internal source-scoped identity for state isolation,
but its descendants cannot be targeted from the caller. Layout and box IDs
create descendant scopes, slot content inherits its slot position's scope,
keyed rows add `key(value)`, table headers/cells add
`header(index)` or `row(index)/col(index)`, and panes add their name.
An ID on the component's root widget is another path segment rather than an
alias for the component scope. For example, a `Dialog #dialog` whose root is
`col #root` and whose input is `#title` exposes `#dialog/root/title`.
Inside a component handler, the path starts at that component instance, so
`task widget focus #title` targets its own `#title` descendant without naming
the call-site scope.
Declared dynamic IDs use `i64` or `str`; keyed rows use bool/i64/f64 and table
indices use i64. Every segment name, key presence, order, and key type must
match a real input, editor, or scroll ID. Static paths lower to
`widget::Id::new`; a path with any dynamic segment lowers to
`widget::Id::from(String)`. An unknown `E172` target reports up to three nearest
valid target paths so missing or reordered scope segments are visible.

Ice exposes all 13 functions in `iced::widget::operation`: previous/next/direct
focus and focus query; cursor front/end/position; select all/range; relative
snap/end; and absolute scroll-to/scroll-by. Effects have no route and
`focused` requires a `bool` route. Cursor and selection positions are
non-negative `i64`; relative offsets are `f64` in `0.0..=1.0`; absolute
offsets are unrestricted `f64`.

Feature-gated native widget selectors use the same checked paths and ordinary
Ice expressions:

```ice
state
  found:widget-target? = none
  matches:[widget-target] = []

on inspect
  task widget find id #dialog(selected)/TaskField/title -> found_one _

on inspect_text
  task widget find-all text "Title" -> found_many _

on inspect_point
  task widget find point 12.0 24.0 -> found_one _

on inspect_focus
  task widget find focused -> found_one _
```

`find` emits an optional result and `find-all` emits a list. Built-in `id`,
`text`, `point`, and `focused` selectors return `widget-target`, including its
kind, optional native `widget-id`, bounds, visible bounds, text content,
scrollable content bounds and translation when the selected target provides
them. Fields unavailable for a target kind are optional. A custom selector
call such as `find-all by_kind("text")` emits the selector declaration's output
type instead. Reading a field through `widget-target?` lifts that field into an
optional result. The consumer must enable iced's `selector` feature.

Persistent pane grids expose their native layout-state operations directly in
handlers:

```ice
pane #workspace maximize details
pane #workspace restore
pane #workspace swap tasks details
pane #workspace move details left
pane #workspace resize 0.6
pane #workspace resize editor_stack 0.55
pane #workspace drop details tasks center
pane #workspace split details preview horizontal ratio=0.4
pane #workspace close details
pane #workspace maximized -> pane_observed _
pane #workspace adjacent tasks right -> pane_observed _
```

Grid names, static pane names, template names, and dynamic key types are checked
against the app view. Effects mutate the compiler-owned `pane_grid::State`
synchronously and do not accept routes. Any pane argument may use
`template(key)`; `split` stores that key and the template resolves the current
item from its declared list state.
`maximized` and `adjacent` are final handler queries and emit `str?`, because
there may be no maximized or adjacent pane. `resize ratio` targets the root
split. A nested `split name axis` declaration gives that native split a stable
checked identity, and `resize name ratio` keeps targeting that split while it
remains in the layout. Ratios are checked `f64` values in `0.0..=1.0`. `drop`
accepts `center` or an edge region. `split` opens a declared closed pane beside
an open target with the requested axis and ratio; asking to open an already-open
pane is a no-op.

Window tasks can open named templates and retain iced's typed window ID in
ordinary Ice state:

```ice
state
  child:window-id? = none

on open_child
  task window open child -> child_opened _

on child_opened(id)
  child = some(id)
  task window size target=id -> window_size _ _

on find_oldest
  task window oldest -> oldest_found _

on find_latest
  task window latest -> latest_found _

on inspect_raw_id
  task window raw-id -> raw_id_read _

on capture_window
  task window screenshot -> window_captured _

on window_captured(value)
  last_capture = value

on change_icon
  task window icon bytes(ff 00 00 ff 00 ff 00 ff) 2 1
```

`open` emits `window-id`; `oldest` and `latest` emit `window-id?`. They require
routes and do not accept `target=`. All per-window effects and queries accept an
optional `target=window-id`; without it they retain the convenient behavior of
resolving iced's oldest initial window. Automatic tabbing is application-wide
and does not accept a target.

Other effects have no route and queries require one. `size` emits two `f64`
values; `maximized` emits `bool`; `minimized` emits `bool?`; `position` and
`monitor-size` each emit two `f64?` values; `scale` emits `f64`; and
`mode` emits `str`. `raw-id` emits the opaque platform `u64` identifier as a
lossless `str`. A `screenshot` route emits one native `window-screenshot`; its
RGBA bytes, physical size, and scale factor are available as typed fields.
`icon` accepts RGBA `bytes`
followed by positive `i64` width and height. Literal byte counts are checked as
`width × height × 4`; dynamic invalid data safely produces no task.

Callback-only iced window behavior crosses one exact typed boundary:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  window describe_window(prefix:str) -> str

on inspect_window
  task window describe_window("main") -> window_described _
```

The Rust item has the ABI
`fn(&dyn iced::window::Window, String) -> String`. The implicit first argument
provides iced's native `HasWindowHandle` and `HasDisplayHandle` access without
putting Rust syntax in Ice. Parameters, output, route, and optional
`target=window-id` are statically checked; generated probes make a missing item
or wrong Rust signature a local rustc error.

Ice covers close, drag and all resize directions, resize
and constraints, resizability, maximize/minimize state, position and movement,
all modes, decorations, user attention, focus, level, system menu, mouse
passthrough, monitor size, runtime RGBA icon changes, and automatic tabbing.
Positive sizes, bool arguments, icon payloads, callback arguments, and target
IDs are checked before Rust generation. Together with the structured platform
blocks and typed callback boundary, this covers iced 0.14's public window
surface.

Every iced window event has a direct subscription form:

```ice
subscribe
  window frame -> frame
  window opened with-id -> opened _ _ _ _ _
  window moved with-id -> moved _ _ _
  window resized with-id -> resized _ _ _
  window close-request with-id -> close_requested _
  window file-dropped with-id -> file_dropped _ _
```

`opened` emits optional x/y followed by width/height; moved and resized emit
two `f64` values; rescaled emits `f64`; file paths emit `str`; and frame,
closed, close-request, focused, unfocused, and files-hovered-left have no
payload. Add `with-id` to any of the eleven non-frame forms to prepend the
originating typed `window-id`; the frame stream is application-wide and has no
window identity. Routes accept only the exact number of `_` payloads. The
modifier also works with `status=`, while Canvas window events reject it because
Canvas receives only the event value.

Every iced mouse event also has a direct subscription form:

```ice
subscribe
  mouse entered -> entered
  mouse left -> left
  mouse moved -> moved _ _
  mouse pressed -> pressed _
  mouse released -> released _
  mouse wheel -> wheel _ _ _
```

Moved emits window x/y as two `f64` values. Pressed and released emit the exact
native `mouse-button`; its `kind` field is `left`, `right`, `middle`, `back`,
`forward`, or `other`, and `number` preserves the optional native `u16` value
as `i64?`.
Wheel emits x/y as `f64` followed by `pixels:bool`; false means iced line
units. These subscriptions observe captured and ignored runtime events. As
with window subscriptions, routes accept only the exact number of `_`
payloads.

All four iced touch events are direct subscriptions:

```ice
subscribe
  touch pressed -> pressed _ _ _
  touch moved -> moved _ _ _
  touch lifted -> lifted _ _ _
  touch lost -> lost _ _ _
```

Each emits `(finger:touch-finger, x:f64, y:f64)`. The typed finger preserves
iced's full native `u64` identity; its `id` field exposes a lossless decimal
string when text is needed. Routes
accept exactly three `_` payloads and observe both captured and ignored touch
events.

### IDs

IDs are identities, not CSS selectors. Static IDs must be unique in their local
view/component scope. Repeated instances use a stable typed key:

```ice
for task in tasks
  TaskRow task=task loading=loading #task(task.id)
```

An ordinary `for` adds no public identity segment: the example exposes
`task(<id>)` directly. The backend may keep a private index scope for automatic
accessibility identities and no-ID component state, but that private scope is
never part of a test or widget-operation target.

The logical identity is hierarchical:

```text
App / component-instance / local-node
Tasks/task(42)/root
```

A component call must have an explicit ID to create a public instance segment.
Without one, it receives an internal source-scoped identity used only for state
isolation. Repeated or externally targeted component calls therefore provide a
stable dynamic or static ID. The iced backend lowers identities to native
widget IDs where Iced exposes them and uses layout/component IDs to build
descendant scopes, so all accepted `#id` forms participate in first-class test
targeting.
Every concrete rendered built-in node accepts a direct `#id`; its test target
uses that node's actual layout and hit-test bounds. `if`, `for`, and `slot` do
not render boxes and therefore accept no IDs. A component-call `#id`
remains an instance scope and must be followed by a rendered descendant ID.

## 9. First-class test mode

A top-level `test` exercises the generated Iced program or one mounted Ice
view. It is part of the same checked source graph as production declarations;
there is no second test-file grammar or Rust registration step.

```ice
test counter_contract
  preset test
  viewport 320 240
  timeout 2s
  mount
    Counter #counter

  target root = #counter/root
  target increment = #counter/increment
  target result = #counter/result

  expect root.width ~= 240.0
  click increment
  expect text "1" within result
```

### Declaration and configuration

A test name uses `snake_case` and is unique across the complete import graph.
Tests may be declared in the root or an imported `.ice` fragment. A test may
have an empty body. `preset`, `viewport`, `timeout`, `theme`, `scale`, `locale`,
`platform`, `reduced-motion`, `mount`, and `target` declarations are optional
and may be mixed with one another, but every such declaration must precede the
first executable step. Each configuration form may appear at most once, and a
target alias name is unique within its test. The same alias may be reused in
another test; definition, references, collision checks, and LSP rename remain
in that one test scope.

Without `preset`, the normal application boot function supplies fresh state
and its initial task. Without `mount`, the complete application view is tested.
A `mount` block contains exactly one ordinary checked view root and replaces
only the view used by that test; it retains the generated app state, update,
theme, tasks, and subscription contract. App and preset handlers may therefore
use widget or pane operations whose target exists only in a test mount; any
mount-only pane state referenced by unconditional generated code is retained in
the production state shape. The default viewport is `1024 × 768`
logical pixels. Explicit dimensions must be positive finite values in the Iced
`f32` range. The default timeout is `2s`; an explicit timeout is a positive
integer followed by `ms` or `s`. Boot or preset tasks settle before the first
step. Because a pane-grid ID names generated persistent state, pane-grid IDs
are unique across the production view and every test mount in one source graph.

The environment declarations are explicit test inputs, not a second
application configuration. `theme light|dark|none` replaces the headless
program's theme result with `Theme::default(mode)` for rendering. It does not
change application-owned palette or theme state; use a preset or `dispatch` to
exercise such state. `scale` overrides the program's positive
logical-to-physical scale factor. When either is absent, the generated program
retains its normal callback result. `locale`, `platform`, and `reduced-motion`
pin metadata and platform-sensitive driver context so fixtures do not inherit
those labels from the host. They do not synthesize an operating-system setting
event or create app state by themselves. The same view, update, task, and
subscription code remains in use. A Rust harness may independently pin the
startup OS preference with `Config::system_theme`; the Ice `system-theme`
action is a post-boot change notification and does not alter the render-theme
override.

### Targets and rendered identity

`target name = #scope/id` gives a checked selector path a local alias. A later
declaration may reuse that path as a prefix, for example
`target title = card/title`; the base must be an earlier alias and the result is
the same checked selector as the expanded absolute path. `#` paths always stay
absolute. Actions and presence/text assertions accept either an alias or a
direct `#` path. Expressions use the alias as a typed test target, for example
`expect card.width == 240.0`. An alias stores its selector, not a candidate or
old bounds: each use resolves against the current rendered tree after the most
recent update. A dynamic selector key may reference an earlier target alias;
self and forward references are rejected. Targets themselves are opaque
identities and are not comparable; compare an explicit field such as `kind`,
`value`, or `width` instead.

Static paths are checked against the normal scoped ID graph. Dynamic keys use
the existing widget-target expression and key-type rules. IDs still represent
identity, not CSS selectors. In particular, a component call ID introduces an
instance scope but no synthetic layout box. Given `Card #card`, a test selects
an explicitly identified rendered descendant such as `#card/root`; targeting
`#card` itself is an error. A missing runtime candidate reports nearby known
IDs instead of guessing.

### Actions and execution

The pointer and focus actions are:

```ice
click target
click target right
double-click target
click-at 120.0 48.0
hover target
enter target
leave
move target
move 120.0 48.0
press target
release
wheel 0.0 -48.0
wheel lines 0.0 -3.0
scroll-to scroller 0.0 240.0
scroll-by scroller 0.0 48.0
snap scroller 0.0 0.5
snap-end scroller
drag source destination
press source
drop destination
focus field
focus-next
focus-previous
blur
window focus
window blur
```

Coordinates and scroll amounts are logical pixels. `scroll-to` sets an absolute
offset and `scroll-by` applies a delta; `snap` uses native relative x/y unit
offsets and `snap-end` selects the end. Targeted pointer operations
resolve the current visible bounds and use their center; coordinate operations
use the supplied point directly. The optional pointer button is `left`,
`right`, `middle`, `back`, or `forward`, and defaults to `left`. `press` keeps
that button down until its matching `release`. `drag from to` is a complete
left-button gesture: it moves to `from`, presses, moves to `to`, and releases.
Standalone `drop target` moves to `target` and releases an already-held left
button, normally established by an earlier `press` and optional `move`. The
driver retains cursor, button, focus, and widget-local state across steps,
including rerenders. Targeted focus and scroll operations first prove that the
resolved widget exposes the matching native capability and then use the exact
widget ID that was matched, including a `StableId`-derived ID. A present but
non-focusable or non-scrollable target therefore fails instead of silently
performing no operation.

Keyboard, text, and input-method actions operate on the current focus:

```ice
type "text"
clear
replace "complete value"
select 0 5
select-all
cursor 5
cursor front
cursor end
composition start
composition update "조"
composition update "조합" 0 3
composition commit "조"
composition cancel
key enter
key "x"
key TVInputHDMI1
key-down escape modified=escape location=standard physical=IntlBackslash text="x" repeat=false
key-up escape modified=escape location=standard physical=IntlBackslash
modifiers shift control
modifiers
chord control shift "p"
repeat backspace 3
```

`key` is one complete press/release. `key-down` and `key-up` expose the two
halves when held state matters. A non-empty quoted string is a character key
value, carried as Iced's string-valued `Key::Character`; it is not restricted
to one Unicode scalar value. Named and physical keys accept ergonomic
lowercase/kebab forms such as `enter`, `arrow-left`, `f1`, `key-a`, and
`numpad-enter`, or the exact Iced UpperCamel variant such as `TVInputHDMI1` and
`IntlBackslash` for complete enum coverage. A down/up step may specify its
modified key, logical location, and physical code. Down events also accept
non-empty event text and the repeat flag; those two options are rejected on
key-up. Shape-valid exact names lower directly to the pinned typed Iced enums;
an unknown variant is rejected by the generated Rust compilation instead of a
duplicated Ice-side enum table. Held-key identity prefers a supplied physical
code while still requiring repeat/release at the original location; without a
physical code it uses the logical key plus location. Simultaneous left/right or
distinct native unidentified keys therefore retain independent lifecycles.
`modifiers` replaces the held modifier set and its bare form clears it. `chord`
applies its listed modifiers for one key. `repeat key count` treats `count` as
the total activation count: one initial non-repeat key-down, `count - 1` repeat
key-down events, then one key-up. `select`, indexed `cursor`, `select-all`, and
the `front`/`end` cursor positions use native widget operations and require
exactly one focused widget ID that exposes Iced's text-input operation.
`clear` and `replace` share that requirement because they begin with
`select-all`. A focused text editor or other focusable widget fails explicitly
instead of being treated as a text input. Negative
indexes and values that do not fit `usize` fail;
otherwise Ice passes the positions to the native operation without an Ice-side
upper-bound or text-length check. Composition steps emit the normal Iced
input-method lifecycle. An optional update selection is a checked UTF-8 byte
range inside the preedit string. A commit does not close the input-method
session, permitting further update/commit cycles; cancel clears preedit state
and emits `Closed`.

Touch, window, system, time, capture, and direct dispatch are also semantic
steps:

```ice
tap target
tap target 2
touch down 1 40.0 60.0
touch move 1 44.0 72.0
touch up 1 44.0 72.0
touch down 2 80.0 90.0
touch cancel 2 80.0 90.0
window move 40.0 60.0
window resize 800.0 600.0
window rescale 2.0
window redraw
window close-request
window opened
window closed
system-theme dark
file-hover "/tmp/report.txt"
file-drop "/tmp/report.txt"
file-leave
wait 50ms
advance 16ms
idle
capture focused_input
dispatch top_level_handler
dispatch top_level_handler(argument, ...)
```

A touch ID is numeric and remains active from `down` until `up` or `cancel`;
multiple IDs permit multi-touch fixtures. `tap` allocates the lowest unused
touch ID for its complete down/up gesture, so explicitly managed contacts may
remain active at the same time. `window resize` updates the retained
viewport before emitting the ordinary Iced resize event; `resize width height`
is its concise equivalent. Move, rescale, focus, close-request, opened/closed,
redraw, file, and system-theme steps likewise travel through the normal
event/subscription path. `close-request` asks the application to close; it does
not bypass the application's close-request handler.

`idle` drains work that is already ready, including task results and
subscription handoffs. `wait` permits the stated amount of real elapsed time
and then settles. `advance` deterministically advances the driver's redraw
timestamp and emits `RedrawRequested`; it deliberately does not virtualize
arbitrary `iced::time` futures. `capture` records the current window as
in-memory RGBA and writes a PNG plus a structured JSON frame manifest. The
default directory is `target/ice-test-artifacts/<sanitized-test-name>/`.
`ICE_TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR` replaces the root while retaining the per-test
directory; a Rust harness may instead set `Config::artifact_dir` to the exact
per-test directory. The manifest records its schema version, capture/PNG
identity, logical and physical sizes, scale, configured theme preference,
resolved render-theme mode/name, system theme, locale/platform/motion context,
window state, redraw-clock guarantees, and every inspectable named target.
Physical captures are limited to 16,777,216 pixels (64 MiB of RGBA8) and reject
zero, overflowing, or mismatched renderer buffers before writing artifacts.
Capture names use lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores. The
returned `Capture` retains RGBA bytes, dimensions, scale, and both artifact
paths. Capture does not perform a golden-image comparison implicitly.
Every manifest target generated from an Ice view carries the `.ice` path, line,
and column of the rendered view node that constructed it. Generated test builds
retain this provenance across imports, component scopes, dynamic IDs, and
rerenders. A target constructed wholly inside Rust without an enclosing Ice
node may report `source: null`.

Every generated app also contains an inert hidden inspection test. It returns
immediately during ordinary test runs; `cargo ice inspect ROOT.ice` activates
only the canonical matching root, constructs the normal app/daemon `Program`,
applies the requested preset and fixed environment, and writes one named PNG
plus JSON manifest. Options cover viewport, preset, render/system theme, scale,
locale, platform, reduced motion, name, output directory, and an explicit Cargo
package for external includes. A fragment without a top-level app/daemon or a
root not included by the selected package is rejected.

`cargo ice diff BASE.json CURRENT.json` recursively compares structured
manifest values and 8-bit RGBA pixels under explicit numeric, channel, and
changed-ratio tolerances. It writes machine-readable `report.json` and a
transparent/red `diff.png`, then exits unsuccessfully for a disallowed delta.
Artifact names, PNG filenames, and capture-statement labels are reported as
ignored identity fields; all rendered and environmental fields participate.
Capture remains observation-only; golden policy belongs to tooling rather
than runtime behavior. A capture delivers a redraw request to the same native
widget tree immediately before drawing so status-aware widgets render their
current active, hovered, pressed, or disabled style; messages produced by that
observational redraw are not applied to application state.

`cargo ice review ROOT.ice` analyzes one complete root graph, runs each
declared first-class Ice test selected by zero or more `--test NAME` options,
and captures stdout, stderr, duration, exit status, and every named frame
artifact. The review output is a versioned JSON report plus an HTML index,
diagnostics inventory, accessibility role/name/action summary, and
source-mapped structured changes. A baseline may be a previous review bundle
or capture directory; a report baseline must carry the `ice_review_bundle`
artifact discriminator, exact schema version, `success: true`, and a typed,
duplicate-free capture list. A capture-diff report is not a review baseline.
Captures match by the stable test/capture manifest key.
When a baseline is supplied, a changed, new, removed, or unreadable capture is
a review failure under the explicit pixel, ratio, and value tolerances. An
explicit `--test` selection filters report keys before resolving, reading, or
checking manifest paths; evidence from unselected tests is outside that run's
baseline scope, while full scope validates every entry. Capture manifests have
schema version 2 and review/diff reports have schema version 1 with distinct
artifact discriminators. Direct diff and review use the same structural
validator for all published required top-level fields and core nested source,
geometry, accessibility, and paint shapes. Test failure also fails the review.
Each run uses a fresh artifact/log/diff subdirectory. Once the output directory
is opened, every early error publishes a failure report, diagnostics, and HTML
for the new run ID; a detailed failure already published for that run is not
replaced by the generic fallback.

`dispatch` constructs the checked message for a top-level handler;
component-local handlers remain private and are exercised through their
rendered controls. Semantic steps keep generated-message construction internal:
tests drive native input, widget state, accessibility, and program events
instead of depending on the private generated message enum.

Every test starts with fresh application state, its own executor/runtime, and
one persistent headless Iced UI cache. Widget-local state, focus, and other
retained widget state therefore survive rerenders within that test but never
leak into another test. The headless runtime models one current window: a
task-issued window open replaces it, retaining application/process context but
resetting widget cache, focus, scroll, cursor, held input, touch, and IME state.
After boot and after every action, emitted widget and
subscription messages are replayed in order through generated update code.
Finite returned tasks and their recursively emitted messages drain before the
next statement. Generated subscriptions are re-established after updates and
receive the same simulated interaction/window events. The timeout protects boot
and finite-task settling from non-quiescent work. Long-lived timer, I/O, and
worker subscriptions are sampled around boot and simulated events; they are not
awaited to global quiescence, because an active subscription may intentionally
be infinite. `wait` is the bounded real-time escape hatch and `advance` controls
only the redraw timestamp; neither turns an infinite subscription into finite
work.

Checked `sync`, future, task, stream, and subscription externs call their real
Rust implementations. Their panics and errors are not hidden. Deterministic
test behavior belongs behind a named preset or a Rust `cfg(test)` implementation
boundary; Ice has no mock layer.

### Assertions and target fields

The assertion forms are:

```ice
expect boolean_expression
expect numeric_expression ~= numeric_expression
expect exists target
expect missing target
expect text string_expression
expect no text string_expression
expect text string_expression within target
expect no text string_expression within target
expect a11y target role "button"
expect a11y target name "Save"
expect a11y target value "Draft"
expect a11y target checked true
expect a11y target disabled false
expect a11y target focused true
expect a11y target action click
expect a11y target action focus false
```

A boolean expectation uses normal checked app-state expressions, equality, and
`sync` extern calls. Component-local state remains private. `~=` converts both
numeric operands to `f64` and uses absolute tolerance `0.001`; non-finite values
fail. Text matching is exact over visible rendered text. `within` restricts the
search to the selected target bounds. `exists` and `missing` are useful for IDs
whose nodes are conditional at runtime.

Accessibility actions and expectations use the same semantic tree exported to
AccessKit:

```ice
a11y focus field
a11y activate submit
```

Role, accessible name/value, checked, disabled, focused, and supported-action
expectations fail when the target has no semantic node instead of falling back
to visual text. `expect a11y ... action name` defaults its expected boolean to
`true`; append `false` to assert that an action is unavailable. The checked
action names are `click` and `focus`, matching the authoritative Snapshot
dispatch surface. `a11y activate` and `a11y focus` dispatch through real
accessibility operations, and reject an unsupported or disabled action with the
originating Ice source location.

A resolved test target exposes these checked fields:

| Family | Fields | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| identity/content | `kind`, `value` | `str` |
| visibility | `visible` | `bool` |
| bounds | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `center_x`, `center_y` | `f64` |
| clipped bounds | `visible_x`, `visible_y`, `visible_width`, `visible_height` | `f64` |
| content bounds | `content_x`, `content_y`, `content_width`, `content_height` | `f64` |
| retained transform | `translation_x`, `translation_y`, `scroll_x`, `scroll_y` | `f64` |
| surface paint | `background`, `border`, `shadow` | native checked value |
| text paint | `text_color`, `text_size`, `font`, `line_height` | native checked value |
| primitive counts | `surface_count`, `text_count`, `image_count` | `i64` |
| text primitive | `text_x`, `text_y`, `text_width`, `text_height`, `text_baseline` | `f64` |
| image primitive | `image_x`, `image_y`, `image_width`, `image_height` | `f64` |
| raster geometry | `pixel_aligned` | `bool` |
| focus | `focused` | `bool` |
| accessibility text | `accessibility_role`, `accessibility_name`, `accessibility_description`, `accessibility_value` | `str` |
| accessibility state | `accessibility_checked`, `accessibility_disabled`, `accessibility_supports_activate`, `accessibility_supports_focus` | `bool` |

`border` exposes its normal `color`, `width`, and `radius` fields. `value` is
available only when the selected runtime candidate exposes text content. The
clipped/content/transform/scroll fields likewise fail at runtime when that
candidate has no corresponding retained geometry. This is deliberate: a
missing measurement is not converted to zero.

Geometry comes from real post-layout Iced bounds in logical pixels. Ice does
not invent a DOM box model or retained `padding`/`gap` values; tests assert
relationships between child and parent bounds. For example,
`expect child.x ~= parent.x + 16.0` checks effective left padding without
coupling the runtime to a CSS abstraction.

Surface and text fields use structured paint output from a real redraw through
the default headless tiny-skia renderer. A surface lookup requires exactly one
quad whose bounds equal the target. A text lookup requires exactly one visible
text primitive inside it. Zero or multiple matches fail with a request for a
narrower ID rather than selecting arbitrarily; count fields let a test establish
that precondition explicitly. Text/image bounds are post-transform logical
pixels, while `pixel_aligned` evaluates the target bounds at the active scale
factor. `text_baseline` is the first visible shaped-line baseline retained by a
paragraph, editor, or raw shaped buffer and fails for cached text when no shaped
run survives. Accessibility fields are strict: an absent semantic node or
property fails rather than returning a fabricated empty value. A custom
headless renderer may still support layout and interaction, but structured
tiny-skia paint fields and visible-text assertions are unavailable. The
checker rejects those assertions when the custom renderer is known statically;
a generic Rust harness receives an explicit runtime failure.

### Failure and generated-code contract

Parser and checker diagnostics reject duplicate test/alias names, declarations
after executable steps, duplicate or invalid configuration, unknown presets,
handlers, aliases, fields, or ID paths, component-scope targets, invalid key
shapes or options, wrong expression types, and unsupported renderer contracts
when known statically. Runtime failures include the test name, normalized Ice
statement, and source path/line; selector, expected/actual values, current
bounds, and nearby IDs are included when relevant. Tests imported through `use`
retain the imported fragment's path and original line rather than the merged
source line.

Each declaration lowers to an ordinary `#[cfg(test)] #[test]` function, so both
`cargo test` and `cargo ice test` discover it. Generated support uses the public
`ui_lang_runtime::testing` API. Every interaction, environment event, time
step, capture, and accessibility action lowers to the semantic,
raw-event-independent `Action` enum and crosses the single
`Driver::perform_action(Action, Location)` boundary. `Config`, `Capture`,
`Target`, paint records, accessibility properties, and `step` complete that
Rust-facing test surface. The `Action` enum is distinct from the application's
private generated message enum, so a non-DSL conformance harness can construct
and replay the same semantic operations without knowing generated internals.
The `step` helper adds Ice source context to panics from generated statement
evaluation. Generated Ice tests need no Rust wrapper, registration, or
application-level dependency on a separate simulator crate.

Revision 2.0 has no DOM, CSS selector engine, computed-style object, synthetic
component bounds, component-local-state access, external test format, test mock
DSL, general virtual clock, built-in golden-image comparator, or multi-window
orchestration. Named captures expose renderer output without making exact pixel
equality the test contract.

## 10. Theme and style

Themes separate a semantic token contract from one or more concrete palettes:

```ice
theme contract Ducktape
  bg
  fg
  primary
  danger
  surface

palette light for Ducktape
  bg #fdfdfb
  fg #171717
  primary #7c3aed
  danger #dc2626
  surface #ffffff

palette dark for Ducktape
  bg #161615
  fg #f5f5f4
  primary #a78bfa
  danger #fb7185
  surface #20201e
```

`bg`, `fg`, `primary`, and `danger` are required contract tokens. Other names
are app-defined. Every palette must target the declared contract and provide
exactly one `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` value for every token; missing, unknown,
duplicate, and invalid-color entries are errors. Palette declarations are
ordered, and the first is the initial default. The declarations generate the
nominal `palette[Ducktape]` type with variants such as `Ducktape.light` and
`Ducktape.dark`. An app selects one with `palette active_palette`; changing that
state changes generated Iced theme fields and every semantic-token style on the
next view. Unknown variants and contract mismatches are compile-time errors.
Selection is an exhaustive generated match, not a string lookup or reactive
theme graph. `white`, `black`, and `transparent` remain built in and cannot be
redeclared. A color may carry opacity, such as `bg-primary/70`.

Apps and nested subtrees may use `default`, `app`, or any of iced's 22 built-in
default-renderer themes. A typed Rust factory covers arbitrary native
`iced::Theme` values without embedding Rust expressions in Ice:

```ice
extern crate::backend
  theme native_theme(dark:bool)

app NativeTheme
  theme native_theme(dark)

view
  theme native_theme(!dark)
    text "Native nested theme"
```

The Rust function has signature `fn(bool) -> iced::Theme`. It may use
`Theme::custom_with_fn` to derive the complete extended palette; generated
probes reject a missing function, wrong arguments, or a different return type.

`@` switches the remainder of a node to checked utility or recipe names. Put
typed properties before it. A semantic recipe gives a repeated visual role one
checked default without adding a runtime style system:

```ice
recipe panel for box
  @w-full p-5 bg-surface border border-border rounded-lg overflow-hidden

recipe action for button
  @text-12.5px font-semibold px-4 py-2 rounded-md disabled:bg-disabled disabled:text-disabled_fg

recipe primary_action for button extends action
  @bg-primary text-primary_fg
  @hover:bg-primary/90 pressed:bg-primary/80

view
  box @panel
    button "Save" @primary_action -> save
```

Recipe names must be unique within their checked namespace. An aliased recipe
resolves an unqualified `extends` base relative to that namespace. A recipe may
contain one or more utility-only lines and targets exactly one of `col`, `row`, `flex`, `grid`,
`stack`, `box`, `text`, `input`, or `button`; `text` also covers rich text and
spans. A recipe may extend at most one recipe with the same target. Missing
bases, target mismatches, and inheritance cycles are `E046`; multiple bases and
free recipe composition are not syntax. Every flattened recipe body is checked
against its declared target even when the recipe is not used by the current
view.

Recipes expand in place at compile time, with the base first and the child
second. Child utility values win, later node utilities win, then direct typed
properties on the node override recipe defaults. This makes
`box p=24.0 @panel` a valid local exception. A direct typed property combined
with a direct utility that owns the same field remains `E045`.

Utilities and recipes are resolved at compile time; there is no CSS engine,
selector matching, runtime cascade, or runtime string parser. Fixed native
widget appearance may use `style=` presets; reusable or state-dependent native
appearance that is more complex than token variants crosses a typed Rust style
or component boundary.

The accepted utility surface is:

| Family | Values | Effective on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| size | `w-full`, `h-full` | row, col, flex, grid, stack, box; `w-full` also input |
| max width | `max-w-sm` through `max-w-2xl` | row, col, flex, grid, stack, box |
| alignment | `items-center` | row, col, flex |
| wrapper alignment | `self-center` | row, col, grid, stack, box |
| overflow | `overflow-hidden` | row, col, flex, grid, stack, box |
| gap | scaled `gap-*` or exact `gap-Npx` | row, col, flex, grid, stack |
| padding | scaled `p-*`, `px-*`, `py-*` or exact `p-Npx`, `px-Npx`, `py-Npx` | row, col, flex, grid, stack, box, input, button |
| text size | `text-xs` through `text-2xl` or exact positive `text-Npx` | text; compact button label |
| line height | `leading-tight`, `leading-snug`, `leading-normal`, `leading-relaxed` | text; compact button label |
| text family | `font-mono` | text; compact button label |
| text weight | `font-medium`, `font-semibold`, `font-bold` | text; compact button label |
| color | `bg-TOKEN`, `text-TOKEN`, `border-TOKEN` | checked per widget |
| border | `border`, `border-2` | visual layout wrappers, box, input, and button |
| radius | `rounded-sm`, `rounded`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-full`, or exact `rounded-Npx` | layout wrappers, input, and button |
| states | `hover:bg-*`, `pressed:bg-*`, `disabled:bg-*`, `disabled:text-*`, `disabled:opacity-*` | button |
| focus | `focus:border-*` | input |

Structured native status blocks use `active` as their shared base. A button's
`hovered`, `pressed`, and `disabled` blocks only need their deltas; input,
editor, combo, slider, and scroll statuses follow the same rule. Checked and
selected controls inherit the corresponding `active checked|unchecked` or
`active selected|unselected` block. `focused-hovered` additionally inherits
`focused`, and `opened-hovered` additionally inherits `opened`. Later,
more-specific fields win.

Scaled spacing values are `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 16 20 24` and map to four
iced logical pixels per unit. An integer `px` suffix selects the exact logical
pixel value instead; exact text size also accepts a positive finite decimal.
Opacity values are `0 25 50 75 100`; color opacity may be any integer from 0
through 100.

`border-TOKEN` and `focus:border-TOKEN` require a border width on the same node,
provided by `border-w=` or a supported wrapper/status `border` utility. A
rounded row, column, grid, or stack requires a background or border, because
iced would otherwise have nothing to round.

The checker rejects both an unknown utility (`E041`) and a known utility on a
node where the iced backend would ignore it (`E042`/`E044`). Silent CSS-like
no-ops are not allowed.

## 11. Diagnostics

Language errors have stable codes and source coordinates:

```text
E132 src/ui/tasks.ice:26:1: unknown handler `save`
E041 src/ui/tasks.ice:61:1: unsupported utility `grid-cols-3`
E042 src/ui/tasks.ice:61:1: utility `gap-4` has no effect on `text`
```

When the resolved source file is readable, command-line rendering includes the
offending line and a caret at the checked column:

```text
E045 src/ui/panel.ice:8:1: style property `width` is set by both `w=` and `@w-full`
8 |   stack w=fill @w-full
  | ^
hint: remove `w=`; `@w-full` sizes both the stack and its generated outer wrapper
```

Imported-file errors use the imported path and excerpt. Callers that only have
an in-memory source, or whose file is no longer readable, retain the compact
coordinate-only form.

`E045` is limited to two current forms that write the same generated field. It
does not reject callback or fixed-preset base styles, `font=` composed with a
font-weight utility, or layout utilities that style only a generated outer
wrapper.
Stack `w-full`/`h-full` write both the stack and its wrapper, so combining them
with typed stack size is rejected. `cargo ice fmt` only normalizes indentation
and blank lines; it never changes language vocabulary.

The `E160-E179` family covers the constructs iced cannot express directly, whose
lowering therefore has limits of its own: `E174` rejects a `tracking=` combined
with a property its grapheme row cannot honour (`wrap=`, `align-x=justified`,
`style=`), `E175` rejects a `tracking=` on literal text that is not latin, and
`E176` rejects a `border-dash=` with no `border=` colour for its stroke to draw
or a statically all-zero pattern.

The implemented families are:

| Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `E000-E019` | document, indentation, theme |
| `E020-E039` | extern, type, and state syntax |
| `E040-E079` | component, statement, view, expression, and style rules |
| `E100-E119` | duplicate declarations and theme semantics |
| `E120-E139` | view, action, and route resolution |
| `E140-E159` | handler and expression types |
| `E160-E179` | IDs and backend lowering constraints |
| `E180-E199` | file imports and source loading |

Successful analysis may also emit stable semantic warnings:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `W001` | a component is unreachable from every application view and first-class test mount |
| `W002` | reachable state has no reader, including state that is written but has no observable consumer |
| `W003` | reachable state has readers but no writer and therefore always keeps its initial value |
| `W004` | handlers form an unconditional immediate routing cycle that can refresh the application forever |
| `W005` | a handler is unreachable from runtime routes, subscriptions, presets, mount, and first-class tests |
| `W006` | handlers form a future, task, query, stream, or progress completion cycle that can refresh or multiply work forever |
| `W007` | an unfiltered raw-event subscription can feed redraw requests back into application updates |
| `W008` | a stateful component is repeated with position-based identity, so inserts or reordering can transfer state between items |
| `W009` | a retained stateful component is mounted under dynamic identities whose stored state is never reclaimed |
| `W010` | a workspace `.ice` file is outside every app or daemon import graph |
| `W011` | a reachable derived value, handler parameter, or handler local is never read |
| `W012` | a statement or view gate is a constant no-op, redundant gate, or dead subtree |
| `W013` | a statement follows an unconditional `return if true` and can never execute |
| `W014` | two subscriptions have the same source, gates, payload mapping, and destination route |
| `W015` | a component with targetable widget IDs is mounted without the public ID scope needed to address them from its caller |

State initializers are not writers. Reads and writes are collected at the
already checked expression, mutation, controlled-binding, and test-expression
sites, with duplicate checker passes collapsed to one source site. Component
state is analyzed only when the component is reachable. `cargo ice` combines
all discovered app roots before reporting `W001`, so a shared component
definition used by any root is not reported as unreachable merely because
another root imports but does not mount it. `W005` starts at the app view,
subscriptions, preset boot statements, the implicit `mount` handler, test
mounts, and test dispatches, then follows every routed effect. Component-local
handlers use their reachable component view as the root. State reads and writes
inside unreachable handlers do not suppress `W002` or `W003`. An init-only
`image` state read without ever being written does not report `W003`: storing
`encoded`/`rgba` handles in never-rewritten state is the documented pattern
that keeps a handle from being minted on every view pass. `W002` still applies
to an `image` state nothing reads. The CLI and LSP
union reachable component and handler definitions over every discovered or open
app root before reporting graph warnings.

`W004` follows task-flow routes that unconditionally emit before any external
effect, immediate `units` routes, and pane-query routes, including routes nested
in task groups. A non-constant `return if` termination guard suppresses outgoing
cycle edges; `return if false` does not. `W006` extends the same graph through
future, task, and query completions plus repeated stream and sip-progress routes.
`W007` reports raw event subscriptions unless they have a filter, request only
captured events, or are statically disabled with `when false`.

`W008` follows component composition through `for`, table-cell, and component
slot scopes. Use `keyed item in items by=stable_key` when repeated children own
state. `W009` covers keyed repetitions, dynamic `#id(key)` scopes, pane
templates, tables, and unkeyed repetitions when the component uses the default
`retained` lifetime; `lifetime mounted` reclaims entries that leave the rendered
tree. `cargo ice` emits CLI-only `W010` after unioning the canonical dependency
graphs of every discovered app and daemon root. Imported fragments and roots are
not orphans; standalone files that no root imports are.

`W011` follows transitive derived-value dependencies and ignores unreachable
handlers. Prefixing an intentionally ignored handler parameter or local with
`_` suppresses it. Preset boot locals and statements participate in the same
`W011-W013` analysis as application handlers. `W012` reports self-assignment,
literal `return if false`, literal `if true`/`if false` gates, and repetitions
over a literal empty list. `W013` reports the first unreachable statement after
a constant-true return.
`W014` compares the full subscription identity, context, filter, condition, event status,
payload arguments, and route; statically disabled `when false` subscriptions are
excluded, so it warns only when an external event would be delivered twice with
identical semantics.
`W015` reports each reachable id-less component call whose definition contains
input, editor, or scroll IDs that an explicit component ID would expose to
widget operations. Component-local handlers may still use their own relative
paths; the warning covers operation paths hidden from the caller and suggests
adding an explicit component ID.

`cargo ice check` first reports these language errors directly, then invokes
`cargo check` so rustc verifies extern items and generated iced types. A missing
Rust item is named by its `crate::module::item` path in rustc's diagnostic.
Imported-language diagnostics already point to the original fragment and line.
Generated Rust carries nested provenance regions for view nodes, handler
statements, state declarations and initializers, derived values, subscriptions,
and extern probes. `ui-lang-build` materializes each root below Cargo's
`OUT_DIR`, and the proc macro expands it through `include!`, preserving rustc's
generated line. `cargo ice check` and `clippy` consume Cargo JSON diagnostics
and map marked error spans back to the root or imported `.ice` file, line, source
excerpt, and syntax while retaining the generated Rust coordinate as a note.
`test` and `compat` first
run the corresponding source-mapped Cargo check, then invoke the normal test
runner. Generated first-class test failures retain their original root or
imported Ice path and line as before.

The LSP exposes the same Clippy remapping as the `Run Ice lint` source action
and `ice.lint` workspace command. The command runs Clippy for every initialized
Cargo workspace root and publishes mapped rustc and Clippy diagnostics under
the responsible `.ice` document URI. Diagnostics without generated Ice
provenance remain with the Rust language server. The command is explicit so
normal edit-time parser and semantic diagnostics do not wait for Cargo.
The LSP publishes error-level generated diagnostics, including type and extern
contract failures. Warning-level Rust and Clippy findings describe backend
output rather than actionable Ice syntax and are suppressed at the generated
item boundary; Ice's non-CLI-only semantic warnings (`W001-W009` and
`W011-W015`) continue to come directly from the language checker.
The command rejects execution while any open workspace Ice buffer differs from
disk, preventing Cargo diagnostics from being applied to a different source
revision.

## 12. Development runner and Cargo commands

`cargo ice dev FILE -- <cargo-build-args> [-- <app-args>]` is the native
development runner. It analyzes `FILE` and its imports with the normal parser
and checker, then builds exactly one selected Cargo binary through the same
ahead-of-time code generator used by production builds. Generated applications
never parse, deserialize, or interpret Ice source at runtime.

Native filesystem notifications over the complete input graph trigger snapshot
verification. Access-only events and events below excluded build, vendor,
fixture, or VCS directories do not trigger verification. The idle runner does
not content-hash the graph on its 100-millisecond process-liveness cadence. If
the native watcher cannot be created or cannot install a required root, the
runner emits `ice dev: native notifications unavailable; using polling safety
mode` and switches to a 750-millisecond metadata-inventory poll. The same
fallback is installed if the native notification channel disconnects. A
fallback metadata change, watcher error, or rescan request triggers the existing
complete content-snapshot verification. The runner also performs a complete
content rescan every 30 seconds, so missed or metadata-invisible changes remain
recoverable. For native notifications naming known files, the
runner reuses the accepted inventory and unchanged content stamps, and hashes
only affected paths. A path absent from the accepted inventories, a removed or
renamed path, or a directory path refreshes the metadata inventory so added and
removed inputs participate without hashing unchanged contents. A change is
settled only when two equivalent snapshots 50 milliseconds apart are identical.
The final stabilized bytes for affected Ice files are reused by incremental
analysis. Unchanged files in the retained import closure are neither read,
hashed, nor scanned again; newly imported files still load from disk.

After a settled Ice, Rust, Cargo, build-script, configuration, or embedded-asset
change, the runner builds a new executable while the accepted process remains
open. It stages the executable under a revision-specific path and launches it
as a shadow candidate with a unique readiness-file path and opaque token. The
generated root wrapper atomically writes that exact token only after its child
draw returns. The candidate becomes accepted only after the runner reads the
exact token and confirms that the process is still alive; then it terminates
the previous process and deletes its staged executable. Parse, check, build,
startup, early-exit, and readiness failures discard the candidate and leave the
previous process running. Every successful edit therefore starts fresh
application, window, and widget state instead of maintaining a second runtime
implementation of Ice.

An app reports readiness through its root view. A daemon uses the same boundary
after one of its windows draws. A windowless daemon candidate has no draw event,
so it reaches the 30-second readiness timeout and never replaces the accepted
process.

The runner executes the selected binary directly, owns both accepted and
candidate children, and removes staged executables on replacement or shutdown.
`Ctrl-C` terminates the owned children without leaving a `cargo run` descendant.

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo build` / `cargo check` | runs `ui-lang-build` in each consumer build script, includes requested roots from `OUT_DIR`, and checks generated Rust |
| `cargo fmt` | formats Rust; foreign `.ice` files are unchanged |
| `cargo clippy` | lints generated Rust as part of the normal crate |
| `cargo ice fmt` | runs Rust formatting and formats all discovered `.ice` files |
| `cargo ice fmt --check` | checks both Rust and Ice formatting without changing `.ice` files |
| `cargo ice check` | language analysis followed by workspace `cargo check` |
| `cargo ice test [cargo-test args...]` | analyzes every Ice app graph, then runs `cargo test --workspace` with the remaining arguments; ordinary Cargo discovers the same generated tests |
| `cargo ice clippy` | language analysis followed by workspace clippy |
| `cargo ice compat` | analyzes app graphs, verifies exact `iced`, `iced_widget`, `ui-lang-build`, runtime, and AccessKit lockfile versions plus direct reference-app/runtime manifest pins, and runs the reference app tests |
| `cargo ice expand FILE` | prints generated Rust for debugging |
| `cargo ice dev FILE -- <cargo-build-args> [-- <app-args>]` | watches complete source/build inputs and replaces the running app only after a rebuilt shadow candidate reports ready |
| `cargo ice inspect FILE [options]` | runs the containing package's generated headless app entry and writes PNG plus source-mapped JSON artifacts for a fixed input tuple |
| `cargo ice diff BASE.json CURRENT.json [options]` | compares structured manifests and RGBA pixels, writes JSON/PNG diff artifacts, and fails outside explicit tolerances |
| `cargo ice api FILE` | checks an app or declaration-only interface graph and prints its deterministic, versioned public API fingerprint |
| `cargo ice api diff BASE.json CURRENT.json [--format human\|json]` | verifies both fingerprints, classifies public changes, and exits nonzero when any breaking change is present |
| `cargo ice review FILE [options]` | runs selected first-class Ice tests and writes one JSON/HTML bundle containing logs, diagnostics, captures, accessibility summary, baseline diffs, and source-mapped changes |
| `cargo ice schema` | prints the generative Core grammar, style and test-mode contracts, editor capabilities, and backend contract as JSON |
| `cargo ice lsp` | serves stdio UTF-16 diagnostics, formatting, context-aware completion, component/recipe hover, component signature help, workspace-edit and `Run Ice lint` source actions, definition, and rename |

`cargo-ice` discovers `.ice` files recursively below the current directory,
skips `.git`, worktree metadata, `target`, and `tests/cases` fixture trees,
analyzes files with a top-level `app` or `daemon` as roots, and formats both
roots and imported fragments.

The schema describes every Core construct's valid contexts, canonical syntax,
child cardinality, typed properties, binding, and route. It also describes test
configuration, actions, assertions, target fields, execution settling, paint
inspection, and runtime support. Completion entries are generated from that
same construct table instead of a separate vocabulary.

The public API fingerprint is a checked semantic artifact, not source text or
generated Rust. Its schema-versioned SHA-256 payload contains the language
revision, containing Cargo package name/version, components (sorted
read/bind/default/required props, named-event payloads, default output,
required/optional slots, and lifetime), recipes (target, base, and base-first
flattened utilities), the global theme token contract, UI enums, extern types,
and all typed extern function kinds. Named declarations and unordered contract
sets are sorted; positional payload and extern parameter order and recipe
utility precedence remain ordered. Consequently formatting, source relocation,
and declaration reordering do not change the fingerprint, while imported bare
and aliased declarations retain their checked `::` identities.

The diff contract is independently schema-versioned. Removed components and
contract members, new required props or slots, read/bind capability changes,
event signature changes, theme-token changes, and extern/type signature changes
are breaking. New components, defaulted props, optional slots, recipes, types,
and extern functions are additive. Recipe flattening, existing default values,
and component lifetime changes require behavioral review. Named events form a
closed routing contract, so adding one is breaking. Package version changes are
metadata; a package name or language revision change is breaking. Malformed,
unknown-schema, or hash-inconsistent inputs are rejected before comparison.
Unknown fields are malformed at every nested schema node, and correctly
rehashed artifacts are still rejected when named contracts are duplicated,
unsorted, or internally inconsistent. Pull-request CI
compares against the target commit's baseline and requires the committed
baseline to exactly match fresh output; an intentional breaking update needs
the explicit maintainer-controlled `api-breaking-approved` label applied after
the latest commit. A later push invalidates that event and requires the label
to be removed and reapplied. Retargeting a pull request reruns the comparison
against the new target commit.
This batch release gate adds no Ice syntax and no LSP method; diagnostics,
completion, hover, signature help, and code actions continue to consume the
ordinary checked document.

The LSP uses Content-Length framed stdio, full-document synchronization, and
the same parser/checker/source map as the compiler. Completion distinguishes
top-level, handler, view, typed-match-arm, widget-status, component-call,
theme-contract, and test contexts.
Checked component calls expose only their read/bind/default props, slots, and
named events; handler completion lowers each Future, Task, and Stream extern to
its valid `run`, `task`, or `stream` form. Component hover and signature help
show the complete contract, while recipe hover flattens utilities base-first.
Code actions return direct workspace edits for binding syntax, missing event and
error routes, handler skeletons, accessible child-content button labels, and
long-node `with` conversion. They can also extract an identical sequence of two
or more inline utilities when it occurs on at least two nodes of the same
recipe target, replacing every exact occurrence with one top-level recipe. A
component's direct app-handler route can become a typed named event when the
payload types and single call site are unambiguous. Code actions also add all
missing explicit Option, Result, or UI-enum arms; selecting a wildcard replaces
it and copies its view body into the generated arms. An unresolved unqualified
component, recipe, extern, or type reference
is qualified only when checking each imported namespace proves exactly one
alias makes the complete source graph valid. Existing file URIs use the
open buffers throughout each import graph; imported diagnostics are published
at the imported URI with UTF-16 ranges. Opening, changing, or closing a buffer
reanalyzes every open app root, and closing it returns that file to disk.
Checked component, handler, recipe, and test-target declarations and references retain
imported source origins, so definition and complete-reference rename use
current open buffers plus closed app roots under the initialized workspace.
Rename validates the new identifier, rejects declaration collisions, and waits
until every app root under the initialized workspace checks. Plain component
names, compound-family roots, and recipe names are renameable; a family-root
rename updates dotted descendants, but direct dotted descendants and the
implicit `mount` handler are definition-only. A test-target alias is renameable
only with its definition and references in the same test; an alias with the same
spelling in another test is unrelated.

The normal runtime and reference-app tests verify deterministic semantic trees,
focus, keyboard activation, visible focus, password suppression, and action
routing. On Linux, `scripts/a11y-smoke.sh` starts an isolated D-Bus/AT-SPI
session and runs the ignored native gate that discovers the exported tree and
delivers its action to the Iced bridge. `scripts/a11y-windows-check.sh`
cross-compiles the Windows adapter, production reference app, runtime tests,
generated reference-app tests, and Core tests from a Linux host; unit and
codegen tests cover oldest-window resolution, deferred show and initial work,
ordered message replay, the headless test bypass, and exact target-scoped
dependency pins. Headless tests cover dispatch from the bridge to the app
message. These gates do not expand the single-window or coordinate contract
above.

## 13. Current coverage and escape hatches

The 2.0 native backend covers both windowed applications and windowless
daemons alongside CRUD/settings-style screens, selection, media, hover
overlays, declarative canvas geometry, and pointer events. Borrowed custom
widgets and an application-wide renderer type remain the escape hatch for
specialized native behavior. [`COVERAGE.md`](COVERAGE.md) is the exact
versioned ledger.

The language must not grow one ad-hoc syntax form for every iced API. Thirty-three
typed Rust boundaries cover domain work, native elements and programs, runtime
tasks and subscriptions, Markdown viewers, and native style callbacks without
admitting arbitrary Rust into expressions or duplicating iced in the core
grammar. Direct native syntax remains preferable for common UI concepts.

Native language coverage and system coverage are therefore separate:

```text
common screen structure -> checked native Ice vocabulary
advanced/custom widget  -> typed Rust Element adapter
custom GPU program      -> typed Rust Shader Program adapter
iced runtime operation  -> typed Rust Task adapter
repeated task output     -> typed Rust Stream/Sipper adapter
event/stream source      -> typed Rust Subscription adapter
native default theme     -> typed Rust Theme factory
alternate themed subtree -> typed Rust Themer adapter
domain and I/O           -> typed Rust async extern
pure domain conversion   -> typed Rust sync extern
native window handle     -> typed Rust window callback
```
