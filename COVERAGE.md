# iced coverage ledger

This ledger defines what “Ice covers iced” means. The baseline is the versions
resolved by this workspace: `iced 0.14.0` and `iced_widget 0.14.2`.

- **native**: accepted Ice syntax is parsed, type-checked, lowered, and compiled
  by the reference application or a focused test.
- **partial**: a useful subset exists, but the public iced feature is not fully
  expressible.
- **missing**: there is no accepted Ice representation yet.

An internal use of an iced widget does not count as coverage. For example, the
backend may wrap layouts in `container`, but only explicit accepted Ice syntax
counts toward the row below.

public behavior has direct documented Ice syntax and tests.

| `Daemon` | native | `daemon Name` lowers to `iced::daemon`, rejects an unnamed initial window, exposes the current typed window ID to each per-window view/title/theme/scale callback, preserves named window templates and all shared settings, and standalone `exit` lowers to the native lifecycle task |
| `Animation<T>` | native | first-class checked `animation[bool]`, `animation[f64]`, and rustc-verified custom Float state map to native `Animation<T>`; every built-in or typed custom easing, preset/ms/s duration, delay, finite/forever repetition, auto-reverse, implicit/exact-instant transition, value/progress/remaining queries, f32/optional-f32 interpolation projection, and active-only native frame subscription are covered |
| explicit image allocation | native | `task image allocate handle` lowers to native `image::allocate` with required exact success/error routes; `image-allocation` retains GPU memory and exposes handle plus exact `Size<u32>`, `image-error` preserves all five native variants with kind/message projections, and `image-memory` plus downgrade/upgrade covers weak retention; requires iced's `image` feature |
| debug timing | native | `debug-span?` owns exact non-clone `iced::debug::Span` state; checked `debug start name -> state` finishes any prior span before native `time`, `debug finish state` consumes it exactly once, `debug.active(state)` reads its presence, and generic `debug.time_with(name, value)` preserves the value type; iced's `debug` feature activates reporting while its native no-op implementation remains available without the feature |
| `Theme` and styles | native | all 22 built-in default-renderer themes, generated app palettes, typed native factories including `custom`/`custom_with_fn` and complete extended-palette logic, app/nested selection, checked color tokens and utilities, complete widget-native catalogs, concrete style fields, and typed runtime callbacks |
| `Task` | native | complete public `iced::Task` construction and composition through async/task/stream/sip externs, direct `done`/`none`, system/clipboard/font/widget/window tasks, `batch`, `chain`, abortable handles including abort-on-drop/query, `map`, output-dependent `then`, optional-or-result `and_then`, `map_err`, result-preserving `collect`, `discard`, and `units`; `future`/`stream` identity forms are represented by perform/run extern sources, and default/unit conversion by `none` |
| `Subscription` | native | complete application-facing construction and composition: typed arbitrary adapters, `none`, `batch`, checked conditional activation/status filters, direct every/repeat timers, native `listen`/`listen_with`/`listen_raw` generic events, input-method/keyboard/mouse/touch/window sources (with optional typed IDs on all eleven discrete window events) and system theme changes, typed `run`/`run_with` workers, custom `Recipe` factories through `from_recipe`, raw `EventStream` filters with hashable identity, `with` identity context, typed `map` routing, noncapturing typed `filter_map`, and `units`; advanced `into_recipes` is runtime-consumer plumbing rather than subscription construction or behavior |
| widget operations | native | all 13 core focus/cursor/selection/scroll operations with checked static/dynamic identity paths through component, layout, slot, keyed, table and pane scopes, typed focus query, native `find`/`find-all` over ID, text, point and focused selectors with complete normalized target metadata, plus custom typed selector factories |
| clipboard | native | standard and primary read/write tasks; reads preserve iced's optional string payload and writes are checked fire-and-forget effects |
| fonts | native | ordered app-level relative font files are checked and embedded into iced's startup loader; runtime bytes lower to native `font::load`; every family/weight/stretch/style descriptor, checked named reference, application default and all widget font setters are covered |
| system | native | current theme task, theme-change subscription, and every information field with optionality preserved; information requires iced's `sysinfo` feature |
| time | native | `instant` maps to iced's native monotonic value; `task time now`, payload-producing `every`, and typed async `repeat` cover the complete enabled `iced::time` task/subscription API with checked positive `ms`/`s` durations (`repeat` requires iced's `tokio` feature) |
| window | native | every initial and named-open setting, including codec-free RGBA icons and structured Linux/Windows/macOS/Wasm fields; typed `window-id`, open/oldest/latest, direct targeting for every per-window close/drag/resize/constraints/state/move/mode/focus/level/menu/attention/passthrough/monitor/raw-ID/screenshot/icon task, automatic tabbing, lossless RGBA screenshot payloads, all 12 event forms with optional IDs on all 11 discrete events, and an exact typed `window::run` callback boundary for raw window/display handles |
| event routing | native | all five structured families plus first-class generic `event` values through native `listen`/`listen_with`/`listen_raw`, optional window IDs, status filters, transforms, handler routing, and typed extern passage; system-theme runtime events remain a separate native source because iced does not represent them as `iced::Event` |
| keyboard | native | all three native events preserve exact `Key`, `Physical`, `Location`, and `Modifiers` values; every named/code/native/location/modifier constructor, structured matching, safe runtime native-code conversion, exact extern passage, and native latin translation are checked Ice expressions |
| mouse/touch | native | every mouse and touch event has a direct typed subscription with exact native `Button` and `Finger` payloads; every button/finger variant, `Cursor` and advanced `Click` constructor, query, projection, vector operation, transformation application, and typed extern passage is covered |
| `Pixels` | native | zero, f32/u32 numeric construction with checked runtime u32 conversion, value projection, equality/order, every native pixels/pixels and pixels/scalar addition, multiplication and division form, and typed extern passage cover the complete public behavior |

| `Padding` | native | zero/default, uniform/per-side/axis constructors, f32/u16-equivalent scalar and axis conversions, exact Pixels conversion, every side and x/y projection, all six native builder methods, `fit`, Size conversion, Rectangle expansion/shrinking, equality, and typed extern passage cover the complete public behavior |
| `Degrees` / `Radians` | native | numeric construction and f64 projection, equality/order including native angle-left scalar comparison, full range constants and containment, Degrees scaling, exact Degrees-to-Radians conversion, PI/display, every native Radians mixed arithmetic form including remainder and reverse scalar multiplication, both `to_distance` points, geometry rotation/vertex integration, and typed extern passage cover the complete public behavior |
| `Rotation` | native | exact floating/solid/default/f32 conversion, radians/degrees/kind projection, native `radians_mut` update, equality, size application, typed extern passage, and direct Image/SVG builder input cover the complete public enum behavior |
| `ContentFit` | native | all five variants/default, compact kind/native display, equality/hashable lazy identity, exact size fitting, typed extern passage, and direct Image/SVG/Viewer builder input cover the complete public enum behavior |
| `Color` | native | default/constants, normalized/static and dynamically checked 8-bit/linear/array constructors, all accepted hexadecimal parse forms with optional rejection, exact channel/RGBA8/linear/display projections, inverse/in-place inversion/alpha scaling, luminance/contrast/readability, equality, and typed extern passage cover the complete public behavior; native floating channels correctly remain unavailable as lazy hash identities |
| `Background` / `Gradient` / `Linear` / `ColorStop` | native | both background variants, every background conversion and alpha scaling, the complete current linear-only gradient enum, linear construction from f32/radians, native sorted single/multiple stop insertion including invalid/eight-stop behavior, alpha scaling, exact optional-stop array projection, every field, equality, typed extern passage, and equivalent solid/linear style sugar cover the complete public behavior; floating values correctly remain unavailable as lazy identities |
| `Font` / `Family` / `Weight` / `Stretch` / `Style` | native | native default and named/monospace constants, exact complete font construction, every descriptor default and variant, static named families, every field and compact kind/name projection, equality, hashable lazy identity, typed extern passage, and equivalent human-readable widget font declarations cover the complete public value behavior |
| `Length` | native | all four variants, static/dynamically checked portion and u32 construction, exact f32/Pixels/u32 conversions, fill factor/fluidity/kind/payload projections, fluid/enclose operations, equality, typed extern passage, and direct passage through every builder that accepts native Length cover the complete public behavior; pixel-only Grid width and slider short axes retain numeric checks, and floating fixed values correctly remain unavailable as lazy hash identities |
| `Alignment` / `Horizontal` / `Vertical` | native | every variant, every bidirectional native conversion, compact kind projection, equality, hashable lazy identity, typed extern passage, and equivalent compact view-property sugar cover the complete public behavior |
| `Border` / `Radius` | native | default/exact border construction, all three border free constructors and builders, every radius free constructor and builder, all four radius numeric conversions with safe dynamic integer forms, native corner-array conversion and scaling, every field, equality, typed extern passage, and equivalent compact style sugar cover the complete public behavior; floating values correctly remain unavailable as lazy identities |
| `Shadow` | native | default and exact color/offset/blur construction, all three field projections, equality, typed extern passage, and deliberate rejection as a floating-point lazy identity cover the complete public behavior |
| `Transformation` | native | identity/default, orthographic, translate, scale, inverse, scale/translation inspection, composition, lossless matrix conversion, equality, typed extern passage, and native application to every supported geometry and pointer value cover the complete public behavior |
| custom widget | native | typed owned or app-state-borrowing `Element` adapters with checked event routing, selected Theme/Renderer propagation, alternate-Theme subtrees, and the complete advanced Widget/Overlay escape hatch |
| custom renderer | native | checked application-wide concrete `iced::program::Renderer` type path propagated through every generated `Element`, including extern components, shaders, alternate themes, and editor adapters |

The free `iced_runtime::task` constructors such as `oneshot`, `channel`,
`blocking`, and `effect` are not re-exported by `iced::task`; they are outside
this public iced baseline. A typed `task` extern can still adapt runtime-specific
work when an application intentionally depends on `iced_runtime`.

## Evidence rule

A row moves to **native** only when every public application-facing behavior in
the pinned iced surface has:

1. documented Ice syntax and static types;
2. parser and semantic-checker coverage, including invalid input;
3. generated Rust that compiles against the pinned iced release;
4. a reference or focused runtime example when behavior is interactive.

The repository does not claim complete iced coverage while any row is partial
or missing.
